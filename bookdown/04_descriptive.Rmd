# (PART\*) UNDERSTANDING YOUR DATA{-}

# Exploring a Variable

Any time you get a new data set to look at, one of the first things you might want to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what **_descriptive statistics_** (as opposed to *inferential statistics*) is all about. In fact, to many people, the term "statistics" is synonymous with descriptive statistics.

The first dataset we'll be looking at is real data relating to the Australian Football League (AFL)^[Note for non-Australians: the AFL is an Australian rules football competition. You don't need to know anything about Australian rules in order to follow this section.]. To do this, let us load the [aflsmall.Rdata](resources/data/aflsmall.Rdata) file.

```{r loadaflsmall, out.width='70%', fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is what you would see after loading the dataset."}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/load_aflsmall.png")
```

CogStat will help you get familiar with some essential aspects of your variable, like:

- measures of central tendency (mean, median)
- measures of variability (range, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, quartiles)
- measures of "distortion" (skewness, kurtosis).

These will help you contextualise the results so the conclusions drawn from the variable will be valid.

To start understanding a variable, select
`Explore variable` so a pop-up appears. Move the name of the data you wish to analyse (in this case: `afl.margins`) from `Available variables` to Selected variables, then click `OK`.

```{r rawaflsmall, out.width='70%', fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is the first chart you will see exploring the raw shape of the data."}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/raw_aflsmall.png")
```

The first piece of information here is $N$, which we will use to refer to the number of observations we're analysing. CogStat (or any other software for that matter) will only use valid data for calculations. Sometimes, mainly when working with survey data, you will have missing data points, the number of which you might have to mention in your written analysis. CogStat will quote these for you:

> `N of valid cases: 176`\
> `N of missing cases: 0`

```{r histogramaflsmall, out.width='70%', fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scrolling down, you'll see CogStat reporting all the descriptive measures while showing you a histogram to understand the shape of your data better. Drawing pictures of the data is an excellent way to convey the gist of what the data is trying to tell you; it's often instrumental to try to condense the data into a few simple summary statistics."}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/histogram_aflsmall.png")
```

In the rest of this chapter, we will explore what these measures mean and what they indicate.

## Measures of central tendency{#centraltendency}

In most situations, the first thing that you'll want to calculate is a measure of **_central tendency_**. That is, you'd like to know something about the "average" or "middle" of your data lies.

### The mean{#mean}

The **_mean_** of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned (arithmetic) average: add all of the values up and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32 (which CogStat will quote to you when loading the data, see Figure \@ref(fig:loadaflsmall)), so the mean of these observations is just:
$$
\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \frac{183}{5} = 36.60
$$
Of course, this definition of the mean isn't news to anyone: averages (i.e. means) are used so often in everyday life that this is quite familiar.

We used $N$ to denote the number of observations. Now let's attach a label to the observations themselves. It's traditional to use $X$ for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we're actually talking about. That is, we'll use $X_1$ to refer to the first observation, $X_2$ to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to $X_N$ for the last one. The following table lists the 5 observations in the `afl.margins` variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rbind(
              c("winning margin, game 1", "$X_1$", "56 points"),
              c("winning margin, game 2", "$X_2$", "31 points"),
              c("winning margin, game 3", "$X_3$", "56 points"),
              c("winning margin, game 4", "$X_4$", "8 points"),
              c("winning margin, game 5", "$X_5$", "32 points")),
col.names = c("the observation", "its symbol", "the observed value"),
  booktabs = TRUE)

```

Okay, now let's try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use $\bar{X}$ as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N}
$$
This formula is entirely correct, but it's terribly long, so we make use of the **_summation symbol_** $\scriptstyle\sum$ to shorten it.^[The choice to use $\Sigma$ to denote summation isn't arbitrary: it's the Greek upper case letter sigma, which is the analogue of the letter S in that alphabet. Similarly, there's an equivalent symbol used to denote the multiplication of lots of numbers: because multiplications are also called "products", we use the $\Pi$ symbol for this; the Greek upper case pi, which is the analogue of the letter P.] If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5$ or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i
$$
Taken literally, this could be read as "the sum, taken over all $i$ values from 1 to 5, of the value $X_i$". But basically, what it means is "add up the first five observations". In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i 
$$

In all honesty, all this mathematical notation doesn't helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, it's really just a fancy way of writing out the same things said in words: *add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items*. The goal here was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we'll be using throughout the book: $\bar{X}$ for the mean, $\scriptstyle\sum$ for the idea of summation, $X_i$ for the $i$th observation, and $N$ for the total number of observations. We're going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so it's important that you understand them well enough to be able to "read" the equations, and to be able to see that it's just saying "add up lots of things and then divide by another thing".
