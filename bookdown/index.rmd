## About this book{.unnumbered}

*Learning Statistics with CogStat* covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students based on Danielle Navarro's original *Learning Statistics with R* (Version 0.6^[This book is compiled from scratch in bookdown but some code snippets rely on [Emily Kothe](https://twitter.com/emilyandthelime)'s bookdown adaptation of the original material (e.g. some knitr plots and tables appear in the source code without alteration), numbered as version [0.6.1](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)]) with a focus on automatic statistical analysis performed in [CogStat](https://www.cogstat.org).

Cogstat is a statistics software written in Python by Attila Krajcsi^[Attila Krajcsi – [Github](https://github.com/krajcsi) | [![](resources/image/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9792-9091) 0000-0001-9792-9091] and developed with the help of supporters. Its distinct advantage is automatic hypothesis test selection and chart creation with an APA style output to suit the needs of psychology researchers and students.
