# Issues to work out

## PDF version

### Critical

- Table and figure numbers inconsistent with website.

### Nice-to-have

- Links should be highlighted. (possible solution: https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-automatically-underline-links/131294/4)
- In-text references to Tables and Figures should hyperlink

## General

### Critical

- Add CS-specific paragraph in #scales (before {#reliability}) discussing how to set your data types prior to loading to CS, and to emphasise that CS will only run the correct analysis based on the type (unlike some other software)
- Reliability examples rewrite based on https://opentextbc.ca/researchmethods/chapter/reliability-and-validity-of-measurement/
- Re-write the chapter on Validity

### Nice-to-have

- In-text references should point to the right ref in References
