The curse of belief bias The Simpson’s paradox – A cautionary tale Statistics in psychology There’s more to research methods than statistics", " Chapter 1 Why do we learn statistics? To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favourite part of one’s psychological education. Not surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn’t happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. Why do you do statistics? Why don’t scientists just use common sense? The best answer is a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach is likely to work. The curse of belief bias Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. Psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the belief bias effect in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn’t. For instance, here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it’s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that’s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand: an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesn’t have to involve true statements. On the other hand, here’s an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn’t, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We’d expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, you’d expect to see data like this: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 100% say “valid” 100% say “valid” argument is invalid 0% say “valid” 0% say “valid” If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That is, it’d be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff. In a classic study, Evans et al. (1983) ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure of the data, everything went the way you’d hope: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” argument is invalid 8% say “valid” Not perfect, but that’s pretty good. But look what happens when our intuitive feelings about the truth of the conclusion run against the logical structure of the argument: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” 46% say “valid” argument is invalid 92% say “valid” 8% say “valid” Apparently, when people are presented with a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see that the argument is weak. It’s just too easy for us to “believe what we want to believe”; so if we want to “believe in the data” instead, we’re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control. That’s what statistics does: it helps keep us honest. The Simpson’s paradox – A cautionary tale In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the problem was that the gender breakdown of their admissions, which looked like this: Number of applicants Percent admitted Males 8442 46% Females 4321 35% Given that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a coincidence. When people started looking more carefully at the admissions data (Bickel et al., 1975) on a department by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants. Table 1.1 shows the admission figures for the six largest departments: Table 1.1: Admission figures for the six largest departments by gender Department Male Applicants Male Percent Admitted Female Applicants Female Percent admitted A 825 62% 108 82% B 560 63% 25 68% C 325 37% 593 34% D 417 33% 375 35% E 191 28% 393 24% F 272 6% 341 7% Remarkably, most departments had a higher rate of admissions for females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How can both of these statements be true at the same time? Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., engineering, chemistry) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., English) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get A&gt;B&gt;D&gt;C&gt;F&gt;E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C&gt;E&gt;D&gt;F&gt;A&gt;B. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And in fact, if we look at all Figure 1.1 we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as Simpson’s paradox. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real. When doing research, there are lots of subtle, counterintuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. Truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data. Figure 1.1: The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from Bickel et al. (1975). Circles plot departments with more than 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of applicants. The crosses plot department with fewer than 40 applicants. Statistics only solves part of the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the “aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department (and there are good reasons to do that), and at the level of individual departments, the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce. If we’re interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in the disaggregated data. In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data, no more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but there’s no substitute for careful thought. Statistics in psychology We hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But we’re guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So here’s an attempt to answer a few of them… Why does psychology have so much statistics? The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. There’s a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment”. The “things” that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy people. The “things” of physics include object like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set. We teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. Can’t someone else do the statistics? To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. There’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics: Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at least understand the basics of stats. Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics. Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. In almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you have to be self-sufficient. Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics. I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics? Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone: we live in the 21st century, and data are everywhere. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section… There’s more to research methods than statistics Most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. Most student fears relate to the statistics part of the course. Hopefully you are convinced that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent. But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. We really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class.

It won’t give you enough information to design studies of your own, but it will provide you with a lot of the essential tools you need to assess the studies done by other people. Since this book focuses more on data analysis than data collection, this only gives a very brief overview. This chapter relies heavily on Campbell &amp; Stanley (1963) for discussing study design and Stevens (1946) for discussing scales of measurement. 2.1 Introduction to psychological measurement First, data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, what we’re trying to do here is measure something about human behaviour or the human mind. What do we mean by “measurement”? 2.1.1 Some thoughts about psychological measurement Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, labels, or other well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement: Danielle’s age is 33 years. She does not like anchovies. Her chromosomal gender is male. Her self-identified gender is female. In the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicised part is “the measurement itself”. We can expand on this a little bit by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case: Age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what the age could be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice, you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150 since no human has ever lived that long. When asked if someone likes anchovies, they might say I do, I do not, I have no opinion, or I sometimes do. Chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. With Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), it is more similar to male than to female. And there are other possibilities, too. Self-identified gender is also very likely to be male or female, transgender, nonbinary, queer etc. As you can see, for some things (like age), it seems pretty apparent what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas, for other things, it gets a bit tricky. But even regarding someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, if you’re a developmental psychologist, measuring in years is way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t all that precise. Generally, when we say “age”, we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only significant point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In a sense, yes. By social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientific perspective, that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often helpful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception. From that perspective, Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. It won’t make much difference when dealing with adults, but when dealing with newborns, it might. In other words, how you specify the allowable measurement values is important. Still, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” will you use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities: You could just ask people, “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age. You could ask an authority (e.g. a parent), “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and it’s not all that hard when dealing with kids since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception” since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. You might need a different authority (e.g. an obstetrician). You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time-consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g. if the person is now dead). 2.1.2 Operationalisation: defining your measurement All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of operationalisation. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalisation is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept and turn it into an accurate measurement. The method of operationalisation can involve several different things: Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research? Determining what method you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question? Defining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? The values aren’t numerical for other types of measurements (e.g. gender). But, as before, we need to consider what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options do we allow them to choose from? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal responses, how will you interpret their answers? Operationalisation is tricky, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. How you operationalise the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. You’ll often find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through case-by-case. Nevertheless, while there are a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general. Before moving on, let’s take a moment to clear up our terminology and, in the process, introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other: A theoretical construct. This is the thing that you’re trying to measure, like “age”, “gender”, or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re a bit vague. A measure. The measure refers to the method or tool used to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure. An operationalisation. The term “operationalisation” refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct or the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct. A variable. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” we end up with in our data sets. In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to understand the differences. 2.2 Scales of measurement As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s handy to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement. 2.2.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities: for these kinds of variables, it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is “bigger’ or”better” than any other one, and it doesn’t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel bizarre to talk about an “average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it. Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose we were researching how people commute to and from work. One variable we would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when we ask 100 people how they got to work today, we get this: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which the options are listed isn’t very exciting. We could have chosen to display the data like this: Transportation Number of people (3) Car 48 (1) Train 12 (4) Bicycle 10 (2) Bus 30 – and nothing really changes. 2.2.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. Consequently, we know that 1st &gt; 2nd, and 2nd &gt; 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. Here’s a more psychologically exciting example. Suppose we’re interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and we ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a suitable match, statement 3 isn’t a perfect match, and statement 4 strongly opposes science. So, in terms of the thing we’re interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), we can order the items as 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4. Since this ordering exists, it would be peculiar to list the options like this: Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are not rising Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why – because it seems to violate the natural “structure” of the question. So, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions and got the following answers: Response Number (1) Temperatures are rising because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can’t do is average them. For instance, in our simple example here, the “average” response to the question is 1.97. We would love to know if someone can tell us what that means. 2.2.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees Celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between 7\\(^\\circ\\) and 10\\(^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables.5 However, notice that the 0\\(^\\circ\\) does not mean “no temperature at all”: it means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as 10\\(^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to claim that 20\\(^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as -10\\(^\\circ\\). Again, let us look at a more psychological example. Suppose we’re interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. We will want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all. 2.2.4 Ratio scale The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In many tasks, it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take 3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8 seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here: Ben took 3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35 times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And you can do this because, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really means “no time at all”. 2.2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle. These definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in-between by taking 3.0 seconds. And, of course, it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice, it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in-between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees Celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table 2.1 summarises the relationship between the measurement scales and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. Some textbooks get this wrong, and people often say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very unfortunate. Table 2.1: The relationship between the measurement scales and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. continuous discrete nominal \\(\\checkmark\\) ordinal \\(\\checkmark\\) interval \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) ratio \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 2.2.6 Some complexities: the Likert scale Okay, I know you’ll be shocked to hear this, but the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life fall into these neat categories, so you need to be careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is all survey designs’ bread and butter tool. You have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” … and then, the options presented to the participant are these: Strongly disagree Disagree Neither agree nor disagree Agree Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case, 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfect example of a 5-point Likert scale too: Strongly disagree Strongly agree Likert scales are convenient, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale since the items are ordered, and they’re not ratio scale either since there’s no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life, it’s pretty apparent they’re not the same. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice, most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice, it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. 2.3 Assessing the reliability of a measurement At this point, we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalise a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. We’ve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. Reliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of our weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if we step on and off the scales repeatedly, it’ll keep giving us the same answer. Measuring our intelligence by means of “asking our mum” is very unreliable. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to its validity). If we’re holding a sack of potatoes when we step on and off bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give us the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match our true weight at all; therefore, it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, while our mum’s estimate of our intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. So that would be an unreliable but valid measure. To some extent, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes, so much so that many would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity. Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability: Test-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get the same answer? Inter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g. someone else rates our intelligence), will they produce the same answer? Parallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if we use a different set of bathroom scales to measure our weight, does it give the same answer? Internal consistency reliability. Suppose a measurement is constructed from many different parts that perform similar functions (e.g. a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions). Do the individual parts tend to give similar answers? Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that Danielle teaches, Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam, several questions are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes, so the exam on its own has a relatively high internal consistency, which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability when you want to measure the same thing! 2.4 The “role” of variables: predictors and outcomes We’ve got one last piece of terminology that needs to be explained before moving away from variables. Usually, when we do some research, we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data, we typically try to explain some of the variables in terms of the other variables. It’s essential to keep the two roles, “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained”, distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables since it’s going to happen repeatedly. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable \\(Y\\), and the variables “doing the explaining” as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc. Now, when we are doing analysis, we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable you use to explain (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study “properly”, then \\(X\\) isn’t dependent on anything else. However, those names are horrible: they’re hard to remember, and they’re highly misleading because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. And, because we’re not the only people who think that IV and DV are just awful names, there are several alternatives that some find more appealing. The terms used in these notes are predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that you’re trying to use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes). This is summarised in Table 2.2. Table 2.2: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. Note that this book will tend to avoid the classical terminology in favour of the newer names. role of the variable classical name modern name to be explained dependent variable (DV) outcome to do the explaining independent variable (IV) predictor 2.5 Experimental and non-experimental research One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between “experimental research” and “non-experimental research”. When we make this distinction, what we’re really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study. 2.5.1 Experimental research The key feature of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (IVs) and then allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs) to see if they have any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that there’s no chance that something other than the predictor variables is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way “balanced” to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is randomisation: that is, we randomly assign people to different groups and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). We’ll talk more about randomisation later in this course. Still, for now, it’s enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise (but not eliminate) the chances that there is any systematic difference between groups. Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters: for instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, not by smoking per se. In technical terms, these other things (e.g. diet) are called “confounds”, and we’ll talk about those in just a moment. In the meantime, let’s now consider what a good experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, suppose we randomly divide participants into two groups and force half of them to become smokers. In that case, it’s doubtful that the groups will differ in any respect other than half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers. 2.5.2 Non-experimental research Non-experimental research is a broad term that covers “any study in which the researcher doesn’t have quite as much control as they do in an experiment”. Control is something that scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates, there are many situations in which you can’t or shouldn’t try to obtain that control. Since it’s grossly unethical (and almost undoubtedly criminal) to force people to smoke to find out if they get cancer, this is an excellent example of a situation where you shouldn’t try to obtain experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our “smoking experiment” does have a few other issues. For instance, when we suggested that we “force” half of the people to become smokers, we must have been talking about starting with a sample of non-smokers and then forcing them to become smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets and also suppose that people who usually smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the “smokers” in our experiment aren’t “natural” smokers (i.e. we forced non-smokers to become smokers; they didn’t take on all of the other normal, real-life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess), they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example, they wouldn’t get lung cancer, and our experiment will fail because it violates the structure of the “natural” world (the technical name for this is an “artefactual” result; see later). One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between quasi-experimental research and case studies. The example from earlier – in which we wanted to examine the incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers without trying to control who smokes and who doesn’t – is a quasi-experimental design. That is, it’s the same as an experiment, but we don’t control the predictors (IVs). We can still use statistics to analyse the results – it’s just that we have to be a lot more careful. The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a few instances. In general, you can’t use statistics to analyse the results of case studies, and it’s usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about “people in general” from a few isolated examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations where you don’t have any alternative: neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just can’t find a lot of people with brain damage in a specific area, so the only thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much care as you can. However, there are also some genuine advantages to case studies: because you don’t have as many people to study, you have the ability to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We won’t talk much about case studies in these lectures, but they are nevertheless very valuable tools! 2.6 Assessing the validity of a study More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea behind validity is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice, it’s much harder to check validity than to check reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed-upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there are lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises its own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. Let’s talk about five different types: Internal validity External validity Construct validity Face validity Ecological validity To give you a quick guide as to what matters here: Internal and external validity are the most important since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. Construct validity asks whether you’re actually measuring what you think you are. Face validity isn’t terribly important except insofar as you care about “appearances”. Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot. 2.6.1 Internal validity Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able to draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first-year students, ask them to write a 1000-word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except – the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables. 2.6.2 External validity External validity relates to the generalisability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study? To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalise to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity. The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as participants. However, the researchers don’t care only about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always risks lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity. That said, it is absolutely critical to realise that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. The choice of population threatens the external validity: if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g. psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicised part is the bit that many people forget: psychology undergraduates indeed differ from the general population in many ways, so a study that uses only psych students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon you’re studying, there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here are two extreme examples: You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity. You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing: People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life. Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life. 2.6.3 Construct validity Construct validity is a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct and inadequate construct validity if it doesn’t. To give a very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose we’re trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way we attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that we can count them. When we do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So we, therefore, conclude that the proportion of cheaters is 0%. Clearly, this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain construct validity. The problem with the measure is that while we’re trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat”, we’re actually measuring “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody-minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So our study has gone wrong because our measurement has very poor construct validity. 2.6.4 Face validity Face validity simply refers to whether or not a measure “looks like” it’s doing what it’s supposed to, nothing more. If you design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and say, “no, that test doesn’t measure intelligence”, then the measure lacks face validity. It’s as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isn’t very important from a purely scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what it’s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what it’s supposed to do. Consequently, we generally don’t care much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes: Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a “hunch” that a particular measure won’t work. While these hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it’s often worth paying attention to them. Because oftentimes people know they can’t quite verbalise, there might be something to worry about even if you can’t quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticises the face validity of your study, it’s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. If you don’t find any reason for concern, you should probably not worry: after all, face validity doesn’t matter much. (Very) often, completely uninformed people will also have a “hunch” that your research is bollocks. And they’ll criticise it on the internet or something. On close inspection, you’ll often notice that these criticisms are focused entirely on how the study “looks”, but not on anything more profound. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further. Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g. this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policymakers of something or other), then you have to care about face validity. Simply because – whether you like it or not – a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific, psychological grounds, then it won’t matter how good your studies “really” are. If they lack face validity, you’ll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, it’s somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but that’s how things go. 2.6.5 Ecological validity Ecological validity is a different notion of validity, similar to external validity but less important. The idea is that, to be ecologically valid, the entire study set-up should closely approximate the real-world scenario being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity – it relates mostly to whether the study “looks” right, but with a bit more rigour to it. To be ecologically valid, the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It’s no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that it’s much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. A simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with a fairly simple array of faces to look at rather than a lineup. The length of time between seeing the “criminal” and being asked to identify the suspect in the “line up” is usually shorter. The “crime” isn’t real, so there’s no chance that the witness is scared, and there are no police officers present, so there’s not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity. 2.7 Confounds, artefacts and other threats to validity If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are confounds and artefacts. These two terms are defined in the following way: Confound: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable6 that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, if the confounding variable causes it, etc. Artefact: A result is said to be “artefactual” if it only holds in the special situation you tested in your study. The possibility that your result is an artefact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalise your results to the actual population you care about. As a general rule, confounds are a more significant concern for non-experimental studies precisely because they’re not proper experiments. By definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing. However, there are always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artefacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artefactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realise that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds). Still, because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild”, you reduce the chances of getting an artefactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artefact. Be warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artefactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g. see 2.7.5). Okay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterised as a confound or an artefact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples… 2.7.1 History effects History effects refers to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen between a pre-test and a post-test. Or in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects: You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you were still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 expressed quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December. You’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g. by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants. 2.7.2 Maturation effects As with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Instead, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects: When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3-year-olds. One thing you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works. When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment 2.7.3 Repeated testing effects An important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g. anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include: Learning and practice: e.g. “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session. Familiarity with the testing situation: e.g. if people are nervous at time 1, this might make the performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like. Auxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g. if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1. 2.7.4 Selection bias Selection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turn out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males), then you’re in a lot of trouble. 2.7.5 Differential attrition One quite subtle danger to be aware of is called differential attrition, which is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, we manage to find a perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. We start running “our incredibly long and tedious experiment” on our perfect sample, but then, because our study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. We can’t stop this: as we’ll discuss later in the chapter on research ethics, participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers, we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that “our incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high dropout rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this dropout is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly, the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom etc., than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that we care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of our results. When thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example above, the differential attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all the conditions in our experiment at about the same rate. The main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry you’ll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases: in other words, you lose external validity. The second type of differential attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, but you also have to worry about your internal validity too. To see why this is the case, let’s consider a very dumb study in which I want to see if insulting people makes them act more obediently. So, we design our experiment with two conditions. In the “treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less cooperative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this dropout isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be those who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody-minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study, insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient: it makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot. 2.7.6 Non-response bias Non-response bias is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalise from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answered every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem. 2.7.7 Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance. Here’s an example. Say we’re interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psych I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university, even though they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve got a big class, there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark, you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your unique skills, and you have to not make any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the thing: intelligence and hard work are transferrable from one class to the next. Luck isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That’s the very definition of “luck”. The consequence of this is that when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless, those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggest that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse, but after the negative reinforcement, they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should expect (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artefact caused by regression to the mean (see Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973 for discussion). 2.7.8 Experimenter bias Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally influence the experiment results by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not – either the right answer to the questions being asked or knowledge of the expected performance pattern for the condition the participant is in, and so on. The classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907 (Hothersall, 2004; Pfungst, 1911). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count and perform other human-like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs. The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double-blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a good solution to the problem, but it’s essential to recognise that it’s not quite ideal and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that we could try to construct a double-blind study is to have one of the PhD students (one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (us) who knows all the details (e.g. correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the PhD student) doesn’t know anything. Except, that last part is improbable. For the PhD student to run the study effectively, they need to have been briefed by us, the researcher. And as it happens, the PhD student also knows a bit about our general beliefs about people and psychology. As a result of all this, it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid learning a little bit about what expectations we have. And even a little knowledge can have an effect: suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion effect”: if you expect great things of people, they’ll rise to the occasion; but if you expect them to fail, they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 2.7.9 Demand effects and reactivity When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants and that these affect people’s behaviour (Rosenthal, 1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching/studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects. The Hawthorne effect captures the idea that people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago (see Adair, 1984). A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied rather than the lighting. To get a bit more specific about how the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment. Still, it might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world: The good participant tries to be too helpful to the researcher: he or she seeks to figure out the experimenter’s hypotheses and confirm them. The negative participant does the exact opposite of the good participant: he or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way. The faithful participant is unnaturally obedient: he or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting. The apprehensive participant gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural or overly socially desirable. 2.7.10 Placebo effects The placebo effect is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials: if you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t treated at all. In other words, it is people believing that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug. 2.7.11 Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects In some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for “all other threats to external validity”. They refer to the fact that the choice of the subpopulation from which you draw your participants, the location, timing and manner in which you run your study (including who collects the data) and the tools that you use to make your measurements might all be influencing the results. Specifically, the worry is that these things might be influencing the results in such a way that the results won’t generalise to a wider array of people, places and measures. 2.7.12 Fraud, deception and self-deception Textbooks assessing the validity of a study often seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not.7 Not only that, but scientists are not immune to belief bias – it’s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, which can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research, and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally “slanted”. Here’s a list of a few ways in which these issues can arise: Data fabrication. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth and may actually reflect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research). Hoaxes. Hoaxes share many similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There are quite a few well-known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g. Piltdown man). Some were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g. the Sokal affair). Data misrepresentation. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more common in my experience to see data misrepresented. Often the data doesn’t say what the researchers think it says. This isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty, but it’s due to a lack of sophistication in the data analysis. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson’s paradox. It’s very common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind, and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself, you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g. the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There are a lot of variants on this, many of which are very hard to detect. Study “misdesign”. Okay, this one is subtle. The issue here is that a researcher designs a study with built-in flaws, which are never reported in the paper. The data reported are authentic and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect, and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it “easy” to (artefactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this – in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself – is to design an experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be doing and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want, you can add all the trappings of double-blind experimentation etc. It won’t make a difference since the study materials are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results, the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader: what’s obvious to the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way we’ve described this makes it sound like it’s always fraud: probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but the bigger concern has been unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes. And so the study just happens to end up with a built-in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication. Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesising. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less lie about what they found is by engaging in what’s referred to as “data mining”. As we’ll discuss later in the class, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, you’ll eventually find something that “looks” like a real effect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers, it’s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it, the bigger the risk you’re taking. The wrong thing is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher runs every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data to cover up the data mining. To be clear: it’s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data and to reanalyse it using your new “post hoc” hypotheses. What is wrong is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done so. If you acknowledge that you did it, then other researchers are able to take your behaviour into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behaviour deceptive. Publication bias &amp; self-censoring. Finally, a pervasive bias is the “non-reporting” of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every article submitted to them: they prefer to publish articles that find “something”. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity 8. This is an example of a publication bias: since no one ever published the 19 studies that didn’t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers “internalise” this bias and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of Danielle’s says, “for every experiment that you get published, you also have ten failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up), others might be genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good” experiment – and telling which is which, is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by Ioannidis (2005) with the depressing title “Why most published research findings are false”. We’d also suggest taking a look at work by Kühberger et al. (2014) presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology. There’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. It’s the obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren’t usually that naive, but for some reason, the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype. 2.8 Summary This chapter isn’t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological research methods: it would require another volume just as long as this one does justice to the topic. However, in real life, statistics and study design are tightly intertwined, so discussing some key topics is convenient. In this chapter, we’ve briefly discussed the following: Introduction to psychological measurement. What does it mean to operationalise a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements? Scales of measurement and types of variables. Remember that there are two different distinctions here: there’s the difference between discrete and continuous data, and there’s the difference between the four different scale types (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio). Reliability of a measurement. If I measure the “same” thing twice, should I expect the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the “same” thing? Well, that’s why we have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are. Terminology: predictors and outcomes. What roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc. Experimental and non-experimental research designs. What makes an experiment an experiment? Is it a nice white lab coat, or does it have something to do with researcher control over variables? Validity and its threats. Does your study measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of research methodology. This chapter is built from the classic little book by Campbell &amp; Stanley (1963), but there are, of course, a large number of textbooks out there on research design. Spend a few minutes with your favourite search engine, and you’ll find dozens. Actually, temperature isn’t strictly an interval scale, in the sense that the amount of energy required to heat something up by 3\\(^\\circ\\) depends on its current temperature. So in the sense that physicists care about, temperature isn’t actually an interval scale.↩︎ The reason why we say that it’s unmeasured is that if you have measured it, then you can use some fancy statistical tricks to deal with the confound. Because of the existence of these statistical solutions to the problem of confounds, we often refer to a confound that we have measured and dealt with as a covariate. Dealing with covariates is a topic for a more advanced course, but it’s comforting to know that it exists.↩︎ Some people might argue that if you’re not honest then you’re not a real scientist. That does have some truth, but that’s disingenuous (google the “No true Scotsman” fallacy). The fact is that there are lots of people who are employed ostensibly as scientists, and whose work has all of the trappings of science, but who are outright fraudulent. Pretending that they don’t exist by saying that they’re not scientists is just childish.↩︎ Clearly, the real effect is that only insane people would even try to read Finnegans Wake.↩︎ "],["cogstat_intro.html", "Chapter 3 An Introduction to CogStat 3.1 How CogStat came about 3.2 An introduction to automatic statistical analysis 3.3 Getting started with CogStat", " Chapter 3 An Introduction to CogStat 3.1 How CogStat came about Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

This is what descriptive statistics (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people, the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics. The first dataset we’ll be looking at is real data relating to the Australian Football League (AFL)9. To do this, let us load the aflsmall.Rdata file. Figure 4.1: This is what you would see after loading the dataset. CogStat will help you get familiar with some essential aspects of your variable, like: measures of central tendency (mean, median) measures of variability (range, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, quartiles) measures of “distortion” (skewness, kurtosis). These will help you contextualise the results so the conclusions drawn from the variable will be valid. To start understanding a variable, select Explore variable so a pop-up appears. Move the name of the data you wish to analyse (in this case: afl.margins) from Available variables to Selected variables, then click OK (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Explore variable dialogue. Figure 4.3: This is the first chart you will see exploring the raw shape of the data. The first piece of information here is \\(N\\), which we will use to refer to the number of observations we’re analysing. CogStat (or any other software for that matter) will only use valid data for calculations. Sometimes, mainly when working with survey data, you will have missing data points, the number of which you might have to mention in your written analysis. CogStat will quote these for you: N of valid cases: 176 N of missing cases: 0 Figure 4.4: Scrolling down, you’ll see CogStat reporting all the descriptive measures while showing you a histogram to understand the shape of your data better. Drawing pictures of the data is an excellent way to convey the gist of what the data is trying to tell you; it’s often instrumental to try to condense the data into a few simple summary statistics. In the rest of this chapter, we will explore what these measures mean and what they indicate. 4.1 Measures of central tendency In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want to calculate is a measure of central tendency. That is, you’d like to know something about the “average” or “middle” of your data lies. 4.1.1 The mean The mean of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned (arithmetic) average: add all of the values up and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32 (which CogStat will quote to you when loading the data, see Figure 4.1), so the mean of these observations is just: \\[ \\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \\frac{183}{5} = 36.60 \\] Of course, this definition of the mean isn’t news to anyone: averages (i.e. means) are used so often in everyday life that this is quite familiar. We used \\(N\\) to denote the number of observations. Now let’s attach a label to the observations themselves. It’s traditional to use \\(X\\) for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we’re actually talking about. That is, we’ll use \\(X_1\\) to refer to the first observation, \\(X_2\\) to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to \\(X_N\\) for the last one. The following table lists the 5 observations in the afl.margins variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to: the observation its symbol the observed value winning margin, game 1 \\(X_1\\) 56 points winning margin, game 2 \\(X_2\\) 31 points winning margin, game 3 \\(X_3\\) 56 points winning margin, game 4 \\(X_4\\) 8 points winning margin, game 5 \\(X_5\\) 32 points Okay, now let’s try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use \\(\\bar{X}\\) as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N} \\] This formula is entirely correct, but it’s terribly long, so we make use of the summation symbol \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) to shorten it.10 If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, \\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\\) or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i \\] Taken literally, this could be read as “the sum, taken over all \\(i\\) values from 1 to 5, of the value \\(X_i\\)”. But basically, what it means is “add up the first five observations”. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\] In all honesty, all this mathematical notation is just a fancy way of laying out the same things said in words: add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items. The goal here was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we’ll be using throughout the book: \\(\\bar{X}\\) for the mean, \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) for the idea of summation, \\(X_i\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation, and \\(N\\) for the total number of observations. We’re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so you must understand them well enough to be able to “read” the equations and to be able to see what they’re really saying. CogStat calculates the mean automatically when exploring a variable using all valid data points, not just the first five. It will be part of the Descriptives for the variable section, as seen in Figure 4.4. The result for our variable is: afl.margins Mean 35.3 4.1.2 The median The second measure of central tendency people use a lot is the median, and it’s even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value11. As before, let’s imagine we were interested only in the first 5 AFL winning margins: 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order: \\[ 8, 31, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] From inspection, it’s evident that the median value of these five observations is 32 since that’s the middle one in the sorted list. Easy stuff. But what should we do if we were interested in the first six games rather than the first 5? Since the sixth game in the season had a winning margin of 14 points, our sorted list is now \\[ 8, 14, \\mathbf{31}, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] and there are two middle numbers, 31 and 32. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is 31.5. In the data set we loaded to CogStat, there were 176 valid cases, so we ought to have two middle numbers. The result in this case is (as seen in Figure 4.4): afl.margins Median 30.5 4.1.3 Mean or median? What’s the difference? Figure 4.5: An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the “centre of gravity” of the data set: if you imagine that the histogram of the data is a solid object, then the point on which you could balance it (as if on a see-saw) is the mean. In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger. Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, what that implies, and which one to choose. This is illustrated in Figure 4.5; the mean is kind of like the “centre of gravity” of the data set, whereas the median is the “middle value” in the data. What this implies about which one you should use depends a little on what type of data you’ve got and what you’re trying to achieve. As a rough guide: If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn’t be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it’s probably best to use the mode (Section 4.1.5) instead. If your data are ordinal scale, you’re more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only uses the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are larger) but doesn’t depend on the precise numbers involved. That’s precisely the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. Conversely, the mean makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it’s not appropriate for ordinal data. For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you’re trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage of using all the information in the data (which is useful when you don’t have a lot of data), but it’s very susceptible to extreme values, as we’ll see in Section 4.1.4. Let’s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section 4.3). This is illustrated in Figure 4.5 notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you’re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here. 4.1.4 Trimmed mean One of the fundamental rules of applied statistics is that the data are messy. Real life is never simple, so the data sets you obtain are never as straightforward as the statistical theory says.12 This can have awkward consequences. To illustrate, consider this rather strange-looking data set: \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] If you were to observe this in a real-life data set, you’d probably suspect that there is something odd about the \\(-100\\) value. It’s probably an outlier, a value that doesn’t belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely. In this particular case, it might be the right call. In real life, however, you don’t always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead: \\[ -15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12 \\] The \\(-15\\) looks suspicious, but not as much as that \\(-100\\) did. In this case, it’s a little trickier. It might be a legitimate observation; it might not. When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values and thus is not considered a robust measure. One remedy that we’ve seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a “trimmed mean”. To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is “discard” the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest) and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median: just like a median, you aren’t highly influenced by extreme outliers, but like the mean, you “use” more than one of the observations. Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observations on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations and the smallest 10% of the observations and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations. Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median. For our toy example above, we have 10 observations. So a 10% trimmed mean is calculated by ignoring the largest value (i.e. \\(12\\)) and the smallest value (i.e. \\(-15\\)) and taking the mean of the remaining values. Mean: 4.1 Median: 5.5 That’s a fairly substantial difference. But the mean is being influenced too much by the extreme values at either end of the data set, especially the \\(-15\\) one. If we take a 10% trimmed mean, we’ll drop the extreme values on either side and take the mean of the rest: Mean: 5.5 Which, in this case, gives exactly the same answer as the median. Currently, there is no direct way for you to do that in CogStat, but you can certainly trim those outlying data points in your source file and re-load the data. 4.1.5 Mode The mode of a sample is straightforward: it is the value that occurs most frequently. In CogStat, you will see a frequency table (Figure 4.6) of the values in your data if you have Frequencies ticked in the Explore variable dialogue. Figure 4.6: The frequency table sorts non-nominal values from lowest to highest. While it’s generally true that the mode is most often calculated when you have nominal scale data – because means and medians are useless for those sorts of variables –, there are some situations in which you do want to know the mode of an ordinal, interval or ratio scale variable. For instance, let’s look at our afl.margins variable we loaded into CogStat. This variable is clearly ratio scale, and so in most situations the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario… a friend of yours is offering a bet. They pick a football game at random, and (without knowing who is playing) you have to guess the exact margin. If you guess correctly, you win $50. If you don’t, you lose $1. There are no consolation prizes for “almost” getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin13 For this bet, the mean and the median are completely useless to you. It is the mode that you should bet on. So, we look at the frequency table offered by the result set: the data suggest you should bet on a \\(3.0\\) point margin, and since this was observed in 8 of the 176 games (4.5% of games – the relative frequency), the odds are firmly in your favour. 4.2 Measures of variability The statistics that we’ve discussed so far all relate to central tendency. They all talk about which values are “in the middle” or “popular” in the data. However, central tendency is not the only type of summary statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the variability of the data. That is, how “spread out” are the data? How “far” away from the mean or median do the observed values tend to be? For now, let’s assume that the data are interval or ratio scale, so we’ll continue to use the afl.margins data. We’ll use this data to discuss several different measures of spread, each with different strengths and weaknesses. 4.2.1 Range The range of a variable is very simple: it’s the largest value minus the smallest value. For the AFL winning margins data, the maximum value is \\(116\\), and the minimum is \\(0\\), so the range is: \\[116-0=\\mathbf{116}\\] CogStat automatically calculates all these values (see Figure 4.4), so there is nothing we need to do about this, only to understand what it implies. Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of “variability”, it’s one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it, we’d like our statistics not to be unduly influenced by these cases. Let us look once again at our toy example of a data set containing very extreme outliers: \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] It is clear that the range is not robust since this has a range of \\(110\\), but if the outlier was removed, we would have a range of only \\(8\\). 4.2.2 Interquartile range The interquartile range (IQR) is like the range, but instead of calculating the difference between the largest and smallest value, it calculates the difference between the 25th and 75th quantile. Probably you already know what a quantile is (or more commonly called percentile), but if not: the 10th percentile of a data set is the smallest number \\(x\\) such that 10% of the data is less than \\(x\\). In fact, we’ve already come across the idea: the median of a data set is its 50th quantile/percentile! Quartile is another specific term used for the 25th (lower), 50th (median), and 75th (upper) percentile, as it is splitting the data set into four (hence ‘quart-’) equal parts.14 CogStat provides you with both the 25th (Lower quartile) and 75th quantiles (Upper quartile): Upper quartile: 50.5 Lower quartile: 12.8 We can see that the interquartile range for the 2010 AFL winning margins data is: \\[ 50.5 - 12.8 = \\mathbf{37.7} \\] While it’s obvious how to interpret the range, it’s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the “middle half” of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile, one quarter of the data is above the 75th percentile, leaving the “middle half” of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half. 4.2.3 Mean absolute deviation The two measures we’ve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at quantiles. However, this isn’t the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select some meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the “typical” deviations from that. What do we mean by “typical” deviation? Usually, the mean or median value of these deviations. In practice, this leads to two different measures, the “mean absolute deviation” (from the mean) and the “median absolute deviation” (from the median). The measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics and might be the better of the two, but it’s less frequently used in psychology, per Danielle’s observation. The measure based on the mean occasionally shows up in psychology; hence we will cover this measure in this chapter. One useful thing about mean absolute deviation is that the name tells you exactly how to calculate it. Let’s think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again we’ll start by pretending that there’s only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case, the mean), the first thing we need to look up is the mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\). For these five observations, our mean is \\(\\bar{X} = 36.6\\). The next step is to convert each of our observations \\(X_i\\) into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). That is, the deviation score is defined to be \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\). For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to \\(56 - 36.6 = 19.4\\). The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of \\(-3\\) as \\(|-3|\\), and so we say that \\(|-3| = 3\\). We use the absolute value function here because we don’t care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean; we’re just interested in how close it is to the mean. To help make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these calculations for all five observations: the observation its symbol the observed value winning margin, game 1 \\(X_1\\) 56 points winning margin, game 2 \\(X_2\\) 31 points winning margin, game 3 \\(X_3\\) 56 points winning margin, game 4 \\(X_4\\) 8 points winning margin, game 5 \\(X_5\\) 32 points Now that we have calculated the absolute deviation score for every observation in the data set, we only have to calculate the mean of these scores. Let’s do that: \\[ \\frac{19.4 + 5.6 + 19.4 + 28.6 + 4.6}{5} = 15.52 \\] And we’re done. The mean absolute deviation for these five scores is 15.52. However, while our calculations for this little example are at an end, we do have a couple of things left to talk about. Firstly, we should really try to write down a proper mathematical formula. But in order to do this, we need some mathematical notation to refer to the mean absolute deviation. Irritatingly, “mean absolute deviation” and “median absolute deviation” have the same acronym (MAD), which leads to a certain amount of ambiguity. What we’ll do is use AAD instead, short for average absolute deviation. Now that we have some unambiguous notation, here’s the formula that describes what we just calculated: \\[ \\mbox{}(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}| \\] The last thing we must discuss is how to calculate AAD in CogStat. Currently, the software does not automatically compute this, and no manual interventions exist. This calculation might get added in a future release if needed, but if you bear with us for two more chapters, you’ll see a more useful measure instead. 4.2.4 Variance Although the mean absolute deviation measure has its uses, it’s not the best measure of variability. From a purely mathematical perspective, there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations over absolute deviations. With square deviations, we obtain a measure called variance. The variance of a data set \\(X\\) is sometimes written as \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\), but it’s more commonly denoted \\(s^2\\). The reason for this will become clearer shortly. The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows: \\[ \\mbox{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] \\[\\mbox{Var}(X) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2}{N}\\] As you can see, it’s basically the same formula that we used to calculate the mean absolute deviation, except that instead of using “absolute deviations”, we use “squared deviations”. For this reason, the variance is sometimes referred to as the “mean square deviation”. Variances are additive. Here’s what that means: suppose we have two variables (\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)), whose variances are \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\) and \\(\\mbox{Var}(Y)\\) respectively. Now imagine we want to define a new variable \\(Z\\) that is the sum of the two, \\(Z = X+Y\\). As it turns out, the variance of \\(Z\\) is equal to \\(\\mbox{Var}(X) + \\mbox{Var}(Y)\\). This is a very useful property, but it’s not true of the other measures. Now that we’ve got the basic idea let’s look at a concrete example. Once again, let’s use the first five AFL games as our data. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table: \\(i\\) [which game] \\(X_i\\) [value] \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) [deviation from mean] \\((X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) [absolute squared deviation] 1 56 19.4 376.36 2 31 -5.6 31.36 3 56 19.4 376.36 4 8 -28.6 817.96 5 32 -4.6 21.16 That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to do is average them. \\[ \\frac{( 376.36 + 31.36 + 376.36 + 817.96 + 21.16 )}{5} = 324.64 \\] Exciting, isn’t it? Now, let’s tackle the burning question you’re probably thinking: What does a variance of 324.64 mean? How do you interpret the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now, the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why we haven’t given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn’t one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it’s utterly useless if you want to communicate with an actual human. Variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable. All the numbers have been squared, and they don’t mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. CogStat will not attempt to interpret the variance nor will it give you the raw value. But the next chapter will show you another measure instead: the standard deviation. 4.2.5 Standard deviation Suppose you would like to have a measure expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e. points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the standard deviation, also called the “root mean squared deviation”, or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly: while nobody has a clue what “a variance of 324.68 points-squared” really means, it’s much easier to understand “a standard deviation of 18.01 points” since it’s expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as \\(s\\), though “SD” and “Std dev.” are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won’t be surprised to see that the formula is: \\[ s = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn’t have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us rely on a simple rule of thumb: in general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation (1 sigma) of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviation (2 sigmas) of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations (3 sigmas) of the mean. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but it’s not exact: it’s actually calculated based on an assumption that the histogram is symmetric and “bell shaped”, i.e. the data are normally distributed, which is an important concept that we’ll discuss more in Chapter 6. So how do we interpret standard deviation? Basically, if the standard deviation is small (relatively closer to zero), then the data are clustered close to the mean. Conversely, if the standard deviation is large (relatively closer to the interquartile range), then the data are more spread out. As you can tell from the AFL winning margins histogram in Figure 4.4, this isn’t exactly true of our data! Even so, the rule is approximately correct. As it turns out, 65.3% of the AFL margins data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. 4.2.6 Median absolute deviation The last measure of variability to talk about is the median absolute deviation (MAD). The basic idea behind MAD is identical to the one behind the mean absolute deviation (Section 4.2.3). The difference is that you use the median everywhere. This has a straightforward interpretation: every observation in the data set lies some distance away from the typical value (the median). So the MAD is an attempt to describe a typical deviation from a typical value in the data set. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to interpret the MAD value of \\(19.5\\) for our AFL data by saying something like this: The median winning margin in 2010 was 30.5, indicating that a typical game involved a winning margin of about 30 points. However, there was a fair amount of variation from game to game: the MAD value was 19.5, indicating that a typical winning margin would differ from this median value by about 19-20 points. In the same way that the mean is very sensitive to extreme values, so is the standard deviation. So, in much the same way that people sometimes use the median as a “robust” way of calculating “something that is like the mean”, it’s not uncommon to use MAD as a method for calculating “something that is like the standard deviation”. Unfortunately, the raw MAD value doesn’t do this. Our raw MAD value is 19.5, and our standard deviation was 26.07. Under the assumption again that the data are normally distributed, you can multiply the raw MAD value by 1.4826 and obtain a number that is directly comparable to the standard deviation. That’s really not true for our afl.margins data, so in this case I wouldn’t try to use the MAD value this way. As standard deviation is used almost all of the time in psychology research, CogStat will not be calculating MAD for you. 4.2.7 Which measure to use? We’ve discussed quite a few measures of spread (range, IQR, MAD, variance and standard deviation) and hinted at their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a quick summary: Range. Gives you the full spread of the data. It’s very vulnerable to outliers, and as a consequence, it isn’t often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data. Interquartile range. Tells you where the “middle half” of the data sits. It’s pretty robust and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot. Mean absolute deviation. Tells you how far “on average” the observations are from the mean. It’s very interpretable but has a few minor issues that make it less attractive to statisticians than the standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often. Variance. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It’s mathematically elegant and is probably the “right” way to describe variation around the mean, but it’s completely uninterpretable because it doesn’t use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool, but it’s buried “under the hood” of a very large number of statistical tools. Standard deviation. This is the square root of the variance. It’s fairly elegant mathematically, and it’s expressed in the same units as the data, so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation. Median absolute deviation. The typical (i.e., median) deviation from the median value. In the raw form, it’s simple and interpretable; in the corrected form, it’s a robust way to estimate the standard deviation for some kinds of data sets. Not used very often, but it does get reported sometimes. In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common measures used to report the variability of the data. Still, there are situations in which range or other measures are used. 4.3 Skewness and kurtosis There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see reported in the psychological literature, known as skewness and kurtosis. In practice, neither is used nearly as frequently as the central tendency and variability measures we’ve discussed. Skewness is critical, so you see it mentioned a fair bit. Figure 4.7: An illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set (skewness \\(= -.93\\)), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (technically, skewness \\(= -.006\\)), and on the right we have a positively skewed data set (skewness \\(= .93\\)). Since it’s the more interesting of the two, let’s start by talking about the skewness. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry, and the easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As Figure 4.7 illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel), then we say that the data are negatively skewed. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are positively skewed. That’s the qualitative idea behind skewness. The actual formula for the skewness of a data set is as follows \\[ \\mbox{skewness}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat{\\sigma}^3} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^3 \\] where \\(N\\) is the number of observations, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) is the standard deviation (the “divide by \\(N-1\\)” version, that is). Not surprisingly, it turns out that the AFL winning margins data is fairly skewed: \\(0.8\\). Put simply, kurtosis is a measure of the “pointiness” of a data set, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. Figure 4.8: An illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a “platykurtic” data set (kurtosis = \\(-.95\\)), meaning that the data set is “too flat”. In the middle we have a “mesokurtic” data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0), which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a “leptokurtic” data set (kurtosis \\(= 2.12\\)) indicating that the data set is “too pointy”. Note that kurtosis is measured with respect to a normal curve (black line) By convention, we say that the “normal curve” (black lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this curve. In this Figure, the data on the left is not pointy enough, so the kurtosis is negative, and we call the data platykurtic. The data on the right are too pointy, so the kurtosis is positive and we say that the data is leptokurtic. But the data in the middle are just pointy enough, so we say that it is mesokurtic and has kurtosis zero. This is summarised in the table below: informal term technical name kurtosis value too flat platykurtic negative just pointy enough mesokurtic zero too pointy leptokurtic positive The equation for kurtosis is similar in spirit to the formulas we’ve seen already for the variance and the skewness. Except that where the variance involved squared deviations and the skewness involved cubed deviations, the kurtosis involves raising the deviations to the fourth power:15 \\[ \\mbox{kurtosis}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat\\sigma^4} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^4 - 3 \\] When reading the automatically calculated kurtosis value from our CogStat result set, we discover that the AFL winning margins data is just pointy enough: \\(0.1\\). 4.4 Summary: descriptives We have covered some key aspects of how to summarise what we have learned about the data. As a summary, the following table lists the measures that CogStat will calculate for you, with a brief explanation of what they are and how they are used.

Smaller figure means more pointy, larger figure means less pointy Range 116.0 The spread of the data set between the maximum and minimum values Maximum 116.0 The highest value in the data set Upper quartile 50.5 25% of the data points reside at and above this value Median 30.5 This is the value of the data point in the middle (or the average of the two middle points in case of even number of data points). 50-50% of data points reside at above and below this value Lower quartile 12.8 25% of the data points reside at and below this value Minimum 0.0 The lowest value in the data set Note for non-Australians: the AFL is an Australian rules football competition.

What we haven’t done is talked about how to describe the relationships between variables in the data. To do that, we want to talk mostly about the correlation between variables. But first, we need some data. After spending so much time looking at the AFL data, let’s turn to a topic close to every parent’s heart: sleep. The following data set is fictitious, but based on real events. Suppose we’re curious to find out how much a baby’s sleeping habits affect the parent’s mood. Let’s say that we can rate parent grumpiness very precisely on a scale from 0 (not at all grumpy) to 100 (very, very grumpy). And, lets also assume that we’ve been measuring parent grumpiness, parent sleeping patterns and the baby’s sleeping patterns for 100 days. Figure 5.1: This is what you would see after loading the parenthood.csv dataset. As described in Chapter 4, we can get all the necessary descriptive statistics for all the variables: parentsleep, babysleep and grumpiness. Let’s summarise all these into a neat little table. Table 5.1: Descriptive statistics for the parenthood data. Parent grumpiness Parent’s hours slept Baby’s hours slept parentgrump parentsleep babysleep Mean 63.7 6.965 8.049 Standard deviation 10 1.011 2.064 Skewness 0.4 -0.296 -0.024 Kurtosis 0 -0.649 -0.613 Range 50 4.16 8.82 Maximum 91 9 12.07 Upper quartile 71 7.74 9.635 Median 62 7.03 7.95 Lower quartile 57 6.292 6.425 Minimum 41 4.84 3.25 5.1 Correlations in Cogstat To start understanding the relationship between a pair of variables, select Explore relation of variable pair so a pop-up appears.

Ideally though, we might want to say a bit more about it than that. For instance, let’s compare the relationship between parentsleep and parentgrump (Figure 5.2 with that between babysleep and parentgrump (Figure 5.3. When looking at these two plots side by side, it’s clear that the relationship is qualitatively the same in both cases: more sleep equals less grump! However, it’s also pretty obvious that the relationship between parentsleep and parentgrump is stronger than the relationship between babysleep and parentgrump. The plot on the left is “neater” than the one on the right. What it feels like is that if you want to predict what the parent’s mood is, it’d help you a little bit to know how many hours the baby slept, but it’d be more helpful to know how many hours the parent slept. In contrast, let’s consider Figure 5.3 vs. Figure 5.4. If we compare the scatterplot of “babysleep v parentgrump” to the scatterplot of “`babysleep v parentsleep”, the overall strength of the relationship is the same, but the direction is different. That is, if the baby sleeps more, the parent gets more sleep (positive relationship, but if the baby sleeps more then the parent gets less grumpy (negative relationship). Figure 5.4: Scatterplot drawn by CogStat showing the relationship between babysleep and parentsleep 5.3 The correlation coefficient We can make these ideas a bit more explicit by introducing the idea of a correlation coefficient (or, more specifically, Pearson’s correlation coefficient), which is traditionally denoted by \\(r\\). The correlation coefficient between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (sometimes denoted \\(r_{XY}\\)), which we’ll define more precisely in the next section, is a measure that varies from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). When \\(r = -1\\) it means that we have a perfect negative relationship, and when \\(r = 1\\) it means we have a perfect positive relationship. When \\(r = 0\\), there’s no relationship at all. If you look at Figure 5.5, you can see several plots showing what different correlations look like. Figure 5.5: Illustration of the effect of varying the strength and direction of a correlation The formula for the Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be written in several different ways. The simplest way to write down the formula is to break it into two steps. Firstly, let’s introduce the idea of a covariance. The covariance between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a generalisation of the notion of the variance; it’s a mathematically simple way of describing the relationship between two variables that isn’t terribly informative to humans: \\[ \\mbox{Cov}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right) \\left( Y_i - \\bar{Y} \\right) \\] Because we’re multiplying (i.e., taking the “product” of) a quantity that depends on \\(X\\) by a quantity that depends on \\(Y\\) and then averaging16, you can think of the formula for the covariance as an “average cross product” between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The covariance has the nice property that, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are entirely unrelated, then the covariance is exactly zero. If the relationship between them is positive (in the sense shown in Figure 5.5) then the covariance is also positive; and if the relationship is negative then the covariance is also negative. In other words, the covariance captures the basic qualitative idea of correlation. Unfortunately, the raw magnitude of the covariance isn’t easy to interpret: it depends on the units in which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are expressed, and worse yet, the actual units that the covariance itself is expressed in are really weird. For instance, if \\(X\\) refers to the parentsleep variable (units: hours) and \\(Y\\) refers to the parentgrump variable (units: grumps), then the units for their covariance are “hours \\(\\times\\) grumps”. And I have no freaking idea what that would even mean. The Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r\\) fixes this interpretation problem by standardising the covariance, in pretty much the exact same way that the \\(z\\)-score standardises a raw score: by dividing by the standard deviation. However, because we have two variables that contribute to the covariance, the standardisation only works if we divide by both standard deviations.17 In other words, the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can be written as follows: \\[ r_{XY} = \\frac{\\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)}{ \\hat{\\sigma}_X \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_Y} \\] By doing this standardisation, not only do we keep all of the nice properties of the covariance discussed earlier, but the actual values of \\(r\\) are on a meaningful scale: \\(r= 1\\) implies a perfect positive relationship, and \\(r = -1\\) implies a perfect negative relationship. 5.4 Interpreting a correlation Naturally, in real life you don’t see many correlations of 1. So how should you interpret a correlation of, say \\(r= .4\\)? The honest answer is that it really depends on what you want to use the data for, and on how strong the correlations in your field tend to be. A friend of mine in engineering once argued that any correlation less than \\(.95\\) is completely useless (I think he was exaggerating, even for engineering). On the other hand there are real cases – even in psychology – where you should really expect correlations that strong. For instance, one of the benchmark data sets used to test theories of how people judge similarities is so clean that any theory that can’t achieve a correlation of at least \\(.9\\) really isn’t deemed to be successful. However, when looking for (say) elementary correlates of intelligence (e.g., inspection time, response time), if you get a correlation above \\(.3\\) you’re doing very very well. In short, the interpretation of a correlation depends a lot on the context. That said, the rough guide in Table 5.2 is pretty typical. Table 5.2: Rough guide to interpreting correlations Correlation Strength Direction -1.0 to -0.9 Very strong Negative -0.9 to -0.7 Strong Negative -0.7 to -0.4 Moderate Negative -0.4 to -0.2 Weak Negative -0.2 to 0 Negligible Negative 0 to 0.2 Negligible Positive 0.2 to 0.4 Weak Positive 0.4 to 0.7 Moderate Positive 0.7 to 0.9 Strong Positive 0.9 to 1.0 Very strong Positive However, something that can never be stressed enough is that you should always look at the scatterplot before attaching any interpretation to the data. A correlation might not mean what you think it means. The classic illustration of this is “Anscombe’s Quartet” (Anscombe, 1973), which is a collection of four data sets. Each data set has two variables, an \\(X\\) and a \\(Y\\). For all four data sets the mean value for \\(X\\) is 9 and the mean for \\(Y\\) is 7.5. The, standard deviations for all \\(X\\) variables are almost identical, as are those for the the \\(Y\\) variables. And in each case the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\(r = 0.816\\). You’d think that these four data sets would look pretty similar to one another. They do not. If we draw scatterplots of \\(X\\) against \\(Y\\) for all four variables, as shown in Figure 5.6 we see that all four of these are spectacularly different to each other. Figure 5.6: Anscombe’s quartet. All four of these data sets have a Pearson correlation of \\(r = .816\\), but they are qualitatively different from one another. The lesson here, which so very many people seem to forget in real life is “always graph your raw data”. 5.5 Spearman’s rank correlations Figure 5.7: The relationship between hours worked and grade received, for a toy data set consisting of only 10 students (each circle corresponds to one student). The dashed line through the middle shows the linear relationship between the two variables. This produces a strong Pearson correlation of \\(r = .91\\). However, the interesting thing to note here is that there’s actually a perfect monotonic relationship between the two variables: in this toy example at least, increasing the hours worked always increases the grade received, as illustrated by the solid line. This is reflected in a Spearman correlation of \\(rho = 1\\). With such a small data set, however, it’s an open question as to which version better describes the actual relationship involved. The Pearson correlation coefficient is useful for a lot of things, but it does have shortcomings. One issue in particular stands out: what it actually measures is the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. In other words, what it gives you is a measure of the extent to which the data all tend to fall on a single, perfectly straight line. Often, this is a pretty good approximation to what we mean when we say “relationship”, and so the Pearson correlation is a good thing to calculation. Sometimes, it isn’t. One very common situation where the Pearson correlation isn’t quite the right thing to use arises when an increase in one variable \\(X\\) really is reflected in an increase in another variable \\(Y\\), but the nature of the relationship isn’t necessarily linear. An example of this might be the relationship between effort and reward when studying for an exam. If you put in zero effort (\\(X\\)) into learning a subject, then you should expect a grade of 0% (\\(Y\\)). However, a little bit of effort will cause a massive improvement: just turning up to lectures means that you learn a fair bit, and if you just turn up to classes, and scribble a few things down so your grade might rise to 35%, all without a lot of effort. However, you just don’t get the same effect at the other end of the scale. As everyone knows, it takes a lot more effort to get a grade of 90% than it takes to get a grade of 55%. What this means is that, if I’ve got data looking at study effort and grades, there’s a pretty good chance that Pearson correlations will be misleading. To illustrate, consider the data plotted in Figure 5.7, showing the relationship between hours worked and grade received for 10 students taking some class. The curious thing about this – highly fictitious – data set is that increasing your effort always increases your grade. It might be by a lot or it might be by a little, but increasing effort will never decrease your grade. The data are stored in effort.csv. CogStat will calculate a standard Pearson correlation first[^Unless of course you set your measurement level in the second row of the csv as “ord” (ordinal), because then you already tell the software that Pearson’s \\(r\\) does not make sense to look at.]. It shows a strong relationship between hours worked and grade received: \\(r = 0.909\\). But this doesn’t actually capture the observation that increasing hours worked always increases the grade. There’s a sense here in which we want to be able to say that the correlation is perfect but for a somewhat different notion of what a “relationship” is. What we’re looking for is something that captures the fact that there is a perfect ordinal relationship here. That is, if student 1 works more hours than student 2, then we can guarantee that student 1 will get the better grade. That’s not what a correlation of \\(r = 0.91\\) says at all. How should we address this? Actually, it’s really easy: if we’re looking for ordinal relationships, all we have to do is treat the data as if it were ordinal scale! So, instead of measuring effort in terms of “hours worked”, lets rank all 10 of our students in order of hours worked. That is, student 1 did the least work out of anyone (2 hours) so they get the lowest rank (rank = 1). Student 4 was the next laziest, putting in only 6 hours of work in over the whole semester, so they get the next lowest rank (rank = 2). Notice that we’re using “rank = 1” to mean “low rank”. Sometimes in everyday language we talk about “rank = 1” to mean “top rank” rather than “bottom rank”. So be careful: you can rank “from smallest value to largest value” (i.e., small equals rank 1) or you can rank “from largest value to smallest value” (i.e., large equals rank 1). In this case, we’re ranking from smallest to largest. But in real life, it’s really easy to forget which way you set things up, so you have to put a bit of effort into remembering! Okay, so let’s have a look at our students when we rank them from worst to best in terms of effort and reward: Student Rank (hours worked) Rank (grade received) student 1 1 1 student 2 10 10 student 3 6 6 student 4 2 2 student 5 3 3 student 6 5 5 student 7 4 4 student 8 8 8 student 9 7 7 student 10 9 9 Hm. These are identical. The student who put in the most effort got the best grade, the student with the least effort got the worst grade, etc. We can rank students by hours worked, then rank students by grade received, and these two rankings would be identical. So if we now correlate them we get a perfect relationship: \\(1\\). What we’ve just re-invented is Spearman’s rank order correlation, usually denoted \\(\\rho\\) (pronounced: rho) to distinguish it from the Pearson correlation \\(r\\). CogStat will use \\(r_{S}\\) to denote rank order correlation. CogStat will calculate both Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank order correlation for you automatically if your measurement is not set in your source data (Figure 5.8). If you set the measurement type to “ordinal” in your source file, it will omit calculating Pearson’s correlation due to the reasons discussed above. Figure 5.8: This is what you would see in CogStat after loading the effort.csv dataset. 5.6 Missing values in pairwise calculations I mentioned earlier that the cor() function is a special case. It doesn’t have an na.rm argument, because the story becomes a lot more complicated when more than one variable is involved. What it does have is an argument called use which does roughly the same thing, but you need to think little more carefully about what you want this time. To illustrate the issues, let’s open up a data set that has missing values, parenthood2.Rdata. This file contains the same data as the original parenthood data, but with some values deleted. It contains a single data frame, parenthood2: &gt; load( &quot;parenthood2.Rdata&quot; ) &gt; print( parenthood2 ) parentsleep baby.sleep parentgrump day 1 7.59 NA 56 1 2 7.91 11.66 60 2 3 5.14 7.92 82 3 4 7.71 9.61 55 4 5 6.68 9.75 NA 5 6 5.99 5.04 72 6 BLAH BLAH BLAH If I calculate my descriptive statistics using the describe() function &gt; describe( parenthood2 ) var n mean sd median trimmed mad min max BLAH parentsleep 1 91 6.98 1.02 7.03 7.02 1.13 4.84 9.00 BLAH baby.sleep 2 89 8.11 2.05 8.20 8.13 2.28 3.25 12.07 BLAH parentgrump 3 92 63.15 9.85 61.00 62.66 10.38 41.00 89.00 BLAH day 4 100 50.50 29.01 50.50 50.50 37.06 1.00 100.00 BLAH we can see from the n column that there are 9 missing values for parentsleep, 11 missing values for baby.sleep and 8 missing values for parentgrump.18 Suppose what I would like is a correlation matrix. And let’s also suppose that I don’t bother to tell R how to handle those missing values. Here’s what happens: &gt; cor( parenthood2 ) parentsleep baby.sleep parentgrump day parentsleep 1 NA NA NA baby.sleep NA 1 NA NA parentgrump NA NA 1 NA day NA NA NA 1 Annoying, but it kind of makes sense. If I don’t know what some of the values of parentsleep and baby.sleep actually are, then I can’t possibly know what the correlation between these two variables is either, since the formula for the correlation coefficient makes use of every single observation in the data set. Once again, it makes sense: it’s just not particularly helpful. To make R behave more sensibly in this situation, you need to specify the use argument to the cor() function. There are several different values that you can specify for this, but the two that we care most about in practice tend to be \"complete.obs\" and \"pairwise.complete.obs\". If we specify use = \"complete.obs\", R will completely ignore all cases (i.e., all rows in our parenthood2 data frame) that have any missing values at all. So, for instance, if you look back at the extract earlier when I used the head() function, notice that observation 1 (i.e., day 1) of the parenthood2 data set is missing the value for baby.sleep, but is otherwise complete? Well, if you choose use = \"complete.obs\" R will ignore that row completely: that is, even when it’s trying to calculate the correlation between parentsleep and parentgrump, observation 1 will be ignored, because the value of baby.sleep is missing for that observation. Here’s what we get: &gt; cor(parenthood2, use = &quot;complete.obs&quot;) parentsleep baby.sleep parentgrump day parentsleep 1.00000000 0.6394985 -0.89951468 0.06132891 baby.sleep 0.63949845 1.0000000 -0.58656066 0.14555814 parentgrump -0.89951468 -0.5865607 1.00000000 -0.06816586 day 0.06132891 0.1455581 -0.06816586 1.00000000 The other possibility that we care about, and the one that tends to get used more often in practice, is to set use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\". When we do that, R only looks at the variables that it’s trying to correlate when determining what to drop. So, for instance, since the only missing value for observation 1 of parenthood2 is for baby.sleep R will only drop observation 1 when baby.sleep is one of the variables involved: and so R keeps observation 1 when trying to correlate parentsleep and parentgrump. When we do it this way, here’s what we get: &gt; cor(parenthood2, use = &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;) parentsleep baby.sleep parentgrump day parentsleep 1.00000000 0.61472303 -0.903442442 -0.076796665 baby.sleep 0.61472303 1.00000000 -0.567802669 0.058309485 parentgrump -0.90344244 -0.56780267 1.000000000 0.005833399 day -0.07679667 0.05830949 0.005833399 1.000000000 Similar, but not quite the same. It’s also worth noting that the correlate() function (in the lsr package) automatically uses the “pairwise complete” method: &gt; correlate(parenthood2) CORRELATIONS ============ - correlation type: pearson - correlations shown only when both variables are numeric parentsleep baby.sleep parentgrump day parentsleep . 0.615 -0.903 -0.077 baby.sleep 0.615 . -0.568 0.058 parentgrump -0.903 -0.568 . 0.006 day -0.077 0.058 0.006 . The two approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. The “pairwise complete” approach has the advantage that it keeps more observations, so you’re making use of more of your data and (as we’ll discuss in tedious detail in Chapter ?? and it improves the reliability of your estimated correlation. On the other hand, it means that every correlation in your correlation matrix is being computed from a slightly different set of observations, which can be awkward when you want to compare the different correlations that you’ve got. So which method should you use? It depends a lot on why you think your values are missing, and probably depends a little on how paranoid you are. For instance, if you think that the missing values were “chosen” completely randomly19 then you’ll probably want to use the pairwise method. If you think that missing data are a cue to thinking that the whole observation might be rubbish (e.g., someone just selecting arbitrary responses in your questionnaire), but that there’s no pattern to which observations are “rubbish” then it’s probably safer to keep only those observations that are complete. If you think there’s something systematic going on, in that some observations are more likely to be missing than others, then you have a much trickier problem to solve, and one that is beyond the scope of this book. Just like we saw with the variance and the standard deviation, in practice we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\).↩︎ This is an oversimplification, but it’ll do for our purposes.↩︎ It’s worth noting that, even though we have missing data for each of these variables, the output doesn’t contain any NA values. This is because, while describe() also has an na.rm argument, the default value for this function is na.rm = TRUE.↩︎ The technical term here is “missing completely at random” (often written MCAR for short). Makes sense, I suppose, but it does sound ungrammatical to me.↩︎ "],["probability.html", "Chapter 6 Probability and distributions 6.1 How are probability and statistics different? 6.2 What does probability mean? 6.3 Basic probability theory 6.4 Distributions 6.5 Summary", " Chapter 6 Probability and distributions Up to this point in the book, we’ve discussed some critical ideas in experimental design and talked a little about how you can summarise a data set. To many people, this is all there is to statistics: it’s about calculating averages, collecting all the numbers, drawing pictures, and putting them all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp collecting, but with numbers. However, statistics cover much more than that. Descriptive statistics is one of the less significant parts of statistics and one of the least powerful. The more valuable part of statistics is that it provides tools that let you make inferences about data. Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms – that statistics are there to help us draw inferences from data – you start seeing examples everywhere. For instance, here’s a small extract from a newspaper article in the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010): “I have a tough job,” the Premier said in response to a poll which found her government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent. This kind of remark is unremarkable in the papers or in everyday life, but let’s consider what it entails. A polling company has conducted an extensive survey because they can afford it. Let’s imagine that they called 1000 NSW voters at random, and 230 (23%) of those claimed that they intended to vote for the ALP. For the 2010 Federal election, the Australian Electoral Commission reported 4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of the remaining 4,609,795 voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown to us. Even assuming that no one lied to the polling company, we can only say with 100% confidence that the actual ALP primary vote is somewhere between 230/4610795 (about 0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 (about 99.83%). So, on what basis is it legitimate for the polling company, the newspaper, and the readership to conclude that the ALP primary vote is only about 23%? The answer to the question is pretty obvious: if we call 1000 people at random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it seems very unlikely that these are the only 230 people out of the entire voting public who actually intend to do so. In other words, we assume that the data collected by the polling company is pretty representative of the population at large. But how representative? Would we be surprised to discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually 24%? 29%? 37%? At this point, everyday intuition starts to break down a bit. No one would be surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised by 37%, but it’s hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need more powerful tools than just looking at the numbers and guessing. Inferential statistics provides the tools we need to answer these questions. Since these questions lie at the heart of the scientific enterprise, they take up the lion’s share of every introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the theory of statistical inference is built on top of probability theory. And it is to probability theory that we must now turn. This discussion of probability theory is basically background: there’s not a lot of statistics per se in this chapter, and you don’t need to understand this material in as much depth as in the other chapters in this part of the book. Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin so much of statistics, it’s worth covering some of the basics. 6.1 How are probability and statistics different? Before discussing probability theory, it’s helpful to consider the relationship between probability and statistics. The two disciplines are closely related, but they’re not identical. Probability theory is “the doctrine of chances”. It’s a branch of mathematics that tells you how often different events will happen. For example, all of these questions are things you can answer using probability theory: What are the chances of a fair coin coming up heads 10 times in a row? If we roll two six-sided dice, how likely is it that we’ll roll two sixes? How likely is it that five cards drawn from a perfectly shuffled deck will all be hearts? What are the chances that we’ll win the lottery? Notice that all of these questions have something in common. In each case the “truth of the world” is known, and my question relates to the “what kind of events” will happen. In the first question, we know that the coin is fair, so there’s a 50% chance that any individual coin flip will come up heads. In the second question, we know that the chance of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1 in 6. In the third question, we know that the deck is shuffled properly. And in the fourth question, we know that the lottery follows specific rules. You get the idea. The critical point is that probabilistic questions start with a known model of the world, and we use that model to do some calculations. The underlying model can be quite simple. For instance, in the coin flipping example, we can write down the model like this: \\[ P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5 \\] which you can read as “the probability of heads is 0.5”. As we’ll see later, in the same way, percentages are numbers that range from 0% to 100%, and probabilities are just numbers that range from 0 to 1. When using this probability model to answer the first question, we don’t know exactly what will happen. Maybe we’ll get 10 heads like the question says. But perhaps we’ll get three heads. That’s the key thing: in probability theory, the model is known, but the data are not. So that’s probability. What about statistics? Statistical questions work the other way around. In statistics, we do not know the truth about the world. All we have is the data from which we want to learn the truth about the world. Statistical questions tend to look more like these: If a friend flips a coin 10 times and gets 10 heads, are they playing a trick? If five cards off the top of the deck are all hearts, how likely is it that the deck was shuffled? If the lottery commissioner’s spouse wins the lottery, how likely is it that the lottery was rigged? This time around, the only thing we have are data. What we know is that we saw a friend flip the coin 10 times, and it came up heads every time. And what we want to infer is whether or not we should conclude that what we just saw was actually a fair coin being flipped 10 times in a row, or whether we should suspect that the friend is playing a trick on us. The data we have look like this: H H H H H H H H H H H and what we’re trying to do is work out which “model of the world” we should put my trust in. If the coin is fair, then the model we should adopt is one that says that the probability of heads is 0.5; that is, \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5\\). If the coin is not fair, then we should conclude that the probability of heads is not 0.5, which we would write as \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) \\neq 0.5\\). In other words, the statistical inference problem is to figure out which of these probability models is right. Clearly, the statistical question isn’t the same as the probability question, but they’re deeply connected to one another. Because of this, a good introduction to statistical theory will start with a discussion of what probability is and how it works. 6.2 What does probability mean? Let’s start with the first of these questions. What is “probability”? It might seem surprising to you, but while statisticians and mathematicians (mostly) agree on what the rules of probability are, there’s much less of a consensus on what the word really means. It seems weird because we’re all very comfortable using words like “chance”, “likely”, “possible”, and “probable”, and it doesn’t seem like it should be a complicated question to answer. If you had to explain “probability” to a five-year-old, you could do a pretty good job. But if you’ve ever had that experience in real life, you might walk away from the conversation feeling like you didn’t quite get it right and that (like many everyday concepts) it turns out that you don’t really know what it’s all about. Let’s suppose we want to bet on a soccer game between two teams of robots, Arduino Arsenal and C Milan. After thinking about it, we decide that there is an 80% probability that Arduino Arsenal winning. What do we mean by that? Here are three possibilities: They’re robot teams, so we can make them play over and over again, and if we did that, Arduino Arsenal would win 8 out of every 10 games on average. For any given game, we would only agree that betting on this game is only “fair” if a $1 bet on C Milan gives a $5 payoff (i.e. we get $1 back plus a $4 reward for being correct), as would a $4 bet on Arduino Arsenal (i.e., $4 bet plus a $1 reward). Our subjective “belief” or “confidence” in an Arduino Arsenal victory is four times as strong as our belief in a C Milan victory. Each of these seems sensible. However, they’re not identical, and not every statistician would endorse all of them. The reason is that there are different statistical ideologies (yes, really!) and depending on which one you subscribe to, you might say that some of those statements are meaningless or irrelevant. In this section, we give a brief introduction to the two main approaches that exist in the literature. These are by no means the only approaches, but they’re the two big ones. 6.2.1 The frequentist view The first of the two major approaches to probability, and the more dominant one in statistics, is referred to as the frequentist view, which defines probability as a long-run frequency. Suppose we were to try flipping a fair coin over and over again. By definition, this is a coin that has \\(P(H) = 0.5\\). What might we observe? One possibility is that the first 20 flips might look like this: T,H,H,H,H,T,T,H,H,H,H,T,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,H In this case, 11 of these 20 coin flips (55%) came up heads. Now suppose that we’d been keeping a running tally of the number of heads (which we’ll call \\(N_H\\)) that we’ve seen, across the first \\(N\\) flips, and calculate the proportion of heads \\(N_H / N\\) every time. Here’s what we’d get: number.of.flips number.of.heads proportion 1 0 0.00 2 1 0.50 3 2 0.67 4 3 0.75 5 4 0.80 6 4 0.67 7 4 0.57 8 5 0.63 9 6 0.67 10 7 0.70 11 8 0.73 12 8 0.67 13 9 0.69 14 10 0.71 15 10 0.67 16 10 0.63 17 10 0.59 18 10 0.56 19 10 0.53 20 11 0.55 Notice that at the start of the sequence, the proportion of heads fluctuates wildly, starting at .00 and rising as high as .80. Later on, one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of the values actually being pretty close to the “right” answer of .50. This is the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell: flip a fair coin over and over again, and as \\(N\\) grows large (approaches infinity, denoted \\(N\\rightarrow \\infty\\)), the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. There are some subtle technicalities that mathematicians care about, but qualitatively speaking, that’s how the frequentists define probability. Unfortunately, we don’t have an infinite number of coins, or the infinite patience required to flip a coin an infinite number of times. However, we do have a computer, and computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. So let’s ask a computer to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times, and then draw a picture of what happens to the proportion \\(N_H / N\\) as \\(N\\) increases. The results are shown in Figure 6.1. As you can see, the proportion of observed heads eventually stops fluctuating, and settles down; when it does, the number at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads. Figure 6.1: An illustration of how frequentist probability works. If you flip a fair coin over and over again, the proportion of heads that you’ve seen eventually settles down, and converges to the true probability of 0.5. Each panel shows four different simulated experiments: in each case, we pretend we flipped a coin 1000 times, and kept track of the proportion of flips that were heads as we went along. Although none of these sequences actually ended up with an exact value of .5, if we’d extended the experiment for an infinite number of coin flips they would have. The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable characteristics. Firstly, it is objective: the probability of an event is necessarily grounded in the world. The only way that probability statements can make sense is if they refer to (a sequence of) events that occur in the physical universe.20 Secondly, it is unambiguous: any two people watching the same sequence of events unfold, trying to calculate the probability of an event, must inevitably come up with the same answer. However, it also has undesirable characteristics. Firstly, infinite sequences don’t exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin from your pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands, it impacts the ground. Each impact wears the coin down a bit; eventually, the coin will be destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to pretend that an “infinite” sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful concept or an objective one. We can’t say that an “infinite sequence” of events is a real thing in the physical universe because the physical universe doesn’t allow infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist definition has a narrow scope. There are many things out there that human beings are happy to assign a probability to in everyday language but cannot (even in theory) be mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of events. For instance, if a meteorologist comes on TV and says, “the probability of rain in Adelaide on 2 November 2048 is 60%”, we humans are happy to accept this. But it’s not clear how to define this in frequentist terms. There’s only one city of Adelaide, and only 2 November 2048. There’s no infinite sequence of events here, just a once-off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely forbids us from making probability statements about a single event. From the frequentist perspective, it will either rain tomorrow or not; there is no “probability” that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. Now, it should be said that there are some very clever tricks that frequentists can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the meteorologist means is something like this: “There is a category of days for which we predict a 60% chance of rain; if we look only across those days for which we make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will actually rain”. It’s very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this way, but you do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it will come up later in this book (see Section ??). 6.2.2 The Bayesian view The Bayesian view of probability is often called the subjectivist view, and it is a minority view among statisticians but one that has been steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are many flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say what “the” Bayesian view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective probability is to define the probability of an event as the degree of belief that an intelligent and rational agent assigns to the truth of that event. From that perspective, probabilities don’t exist in the world but rather in the thoughts and assumptions of people and other intelligent beings. However, for this approach to work, we need some way of operationalising the “degree of belief”. One way you can do this is to formalise it in terms of “rational gambling”, though there are many other ways. Suppose that we believe that there’s a 60% probability of rain tomorrow. If someone offers us a bet: if it rains tomorrow, then we win $5, but if it doesn’t rain, then we lose $5. Clearly, from our perspective, this is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if we think the probability of rain is only 40%, then it’s a bad bet. Thus, we can operationalise the notion of a “subjective probability” in terms of what bets we’re willing to accept. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian approach? The main advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event you want to. You don’t need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can’t be purely objective – specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity with the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician, but there has to be an intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people, this is uncomfortable: it seems to make probability arbitrary. While the Bayesian approach does require that the agent in question be rational (i.e., obey the rules of probability), it does allow everyone to have their own beliefs; I can believe the coin is fair, and you don’t have to, even though we’re both rational. The frequentist view doesn’t allow any two observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event: when that happens, then at least one of them must be wrong. The Bayesian view does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with different background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about the same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes considered to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to assign probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too broad (allows too many differences between observers). 6.2.3 What’s the difference? And who is right? Now that you’ve seen these two views independently, it’s useful to make sure you can compare them. Go back to the hypothetical robot soccer game at the start of the section. What would a frequentist and a Bayesian say about these three statements? Which statement would a frequentist say is the correct definition of probability? Which one would a Bayesian do? Would some of these statements be meaningless to a frequentist or a Bayesian? If you’ve understood the two perspectives, you should have some sense of how to answer those questions. Okay, assuming you understand the difference, you might be wondering which of them is right? Honestly, we don’t know that there is a right answer. As far as we can tell, there’s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way frequentists think about sequences of events, and there’s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way that Bayesians define the beliefs of a rational agent. In fact, when you dig down into the details, Bayesians and frequentists actually agree about a lot of things. Many frequentist methods lead to decisions that Bayesians agree a rational agent would make. Many Bayesian methods have very good frequentist properties. Consider Sir Ronald Fisher, one of the towering figures of 20th-century statistics and a vehement opponent of all things Bayesian, whose paper on the mathematical foundations of statistics referred to Bayesian probability as “an impenetrable jungle [that] arrests progress towards precision of statistical concepts” Fisher (1922). Or the psychologist Paul Meehl, who suggests that relying on frequentist methods could turn you into “a potent but sterile intellectual rake who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring” Meehl (1967). The history of statistics, as you might gather, is not devoid of entertainment. In any case, while Danielle personally prefers the Bayesian view, the majority of statistical analyses are based on the frequentist approach. My reasoning is pragmatic: the goal of this book is to cover roughly the same territory as a typical undergraduate stats class in psychology, and if you want to understand the statistical tools used by most psychologists, you’ll need a good grasp of frequentist methods. We promise you that this isn’t a wasted effort. Even if you end up wanting to switch to the Bayesian perspective, you really should read through at least one book on the “orthodox” frequentist view. Every now and then, we’ll add some commentary from a Bayesian point of view, and we’ll revisit the topic in more depth in Chapter ??. 6.3 Basic probability theory Although there are ideological arguments between Bayesians and frequentists, it turns out that people mostly agree on the rules that probabilities should obey. There are lots of different ways of arriving at these rules. The most commonly used approach is based on the work of Andrey Kolmogorov, one of the great Soviet mathematicians of the 20th century. Without going into a lot of detail, we’ll try to give you a sense of how it works. Let’s assume we own five pairs of pants: three pairs of jeans, the bottom half of a suit, and a pair of tracksuit pants. Let’s call them \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(X_3\\), \\(X_4\\) and \\(X_5\\). Now, on any given day, we pick out exactly one pair of pants. If we were to describe this situation using the language of probability theory, we would refer to each pair of pants (i.e., each \\(X\\)) as an elementary event. The key characteristic of elementary events is that every time we make an observation (e.g., every time we put on a pair of pants), then the outcome will be one and only one of these events. As said, we only wear exactly one pair of pants, so it satisfies this constraint. Similarly, the set of all possible events is called a sample space. Okay, now that we have a sample space (a wardrobe) built from lots of possible elementary events (pants), we want to assign a probability of one of these elementary events. For an event \\(X\\), the probability of that event \\(P(X)\\) is a number that lies between 0 and 1. The bigger the value of \\(P(X)\\), the more likely the event will occur. So, for example, if \\(P(X) = 0\\), it means the event \\(X\\) is impossible (i.e., we never wear those pants). On the other hand, if \\(P(X) = 1\\) it means that event \\(X\\) is certain to occur (i.e., we always wear those pants). For probability values in the middle, it means that we sometimes wear those pants. For instance, if \\(P(X) = 0.5\\), it means that we wear those pants half of the time. At this point, we’re almost done. The last thing we need to recognise is that “something always happens”. Every time we put on pants, we really do end up wearing pants (crazy, right?). What this somewhat trite statement means, in probabilistic terms, is that the probabilities of the elementary events need to add up to 1. This is known as the law of total probability. More importantly, if these requirements are satisfied, then we have a probability distribution. For example, this is an example of a probability distribution Which.pants Blue.jeans Grey.jeans Black.jeans Black.suit Blue.tracksuit Label \\(X_1\\) \\(X_2\\) \\(X_3\\) \\(X_4\\) \\(X_5\\) Probability \\(P(X_1) = .5\\) \\(P(X_2) = .3\\) \\(P(X_3) = .1\\) \\(P(X_4) = 0\\) \\(P(X_5) = .1\\) Each of the events has a probability that lies between 0 and 1, and if we add up the probability of all events, they sum to 1, as shown in Figure 6.2. And at this point, we’ve all achieved something. You’ve learned what probability distribution is. Figure 6.2: A visual depiction of the “pants” probability distribution. There are five “elementary events”, corresponding to the five pairs of pants. Each event has some probability of occurring: this probability is a number between 0 to 1. The sum of these probabilities is 1. The only other thing that needs pointing out is that probability theory allows you to talk about non-elementary events as well as elementary ones. The easiest way to illustrate the concept is with an example. In the pants example, it’s legitimate to refer to the probability that we wear jeans. In this scenario, the “We wear jeans” event is said to have happened as long as the elementary event that actually did occur is one of the appropriate ones; in this case “blue jeans”, “black jeans”, or “grey jeans”. In mathematical terms, we defined the “jeans” event \\(E\\) to correspond to the set of elementary events \\((X_1, X_2, X_3)\\). If any of these elementary events occurs, then \\(E\\) is also said to have occurred. Having decided to write down the definition of the \\(E\\) this way, it’s pretty straightforward to state what the probability \\(P(E)\\) is: we just add everything up. In this particular case \\[ P(E) = P(X_1) + P(X_2) + P(X_3) \\] and, since the probabilities of blue, grey and black jeans respectively are .5, .3 and .1, the probability that we wear jeans is equal to .9. At this point, you might be thinking that this is all terribly obvious and simple, and you’d be right. All we’ve done is wrap some basic mathematics around a few common sense intuitions. However, from these simple beginnings, it’s possible to construct some extremely powerful mathematical tools. Without going into the details in this book, we list – in Table 6.1 – some of the other rules that probabilities satisfy. These rules can be derived from the simple assumptions that we’ve outlined above. Table 6.1: Some basic rules that probabilities must satisfy. You don’t really need to know these rules in order to understand the analyses that we’ll talk about later in the book, but they are important if you want to understand probability theory a bit more deeply. English Notation NANA Formula Not \\(A\\) \\(P(\\neg A)\\) = \\(1-P(A)\\) \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) = \\(P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) = \\(P(A|B) P(B)\\) 6.4 Distributions As you might imagine, probability distributions vary enormously, and there’s an enormous range of distributions. However, they aren’t all equally important. In fact, the vast majority of the content in this book relies on one of five distributions: the binomial distribution, the normal distribution, the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) (“chi-square”) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. Given this, the next few sections will briefly introduce all five of these, paying special attention to the binomial and the normal. 6.4.1 The binomial distribution The theory of probability originated in an attempt to describe how games of chance work. Hence, it seems fitting that our discussion of the binomial distribution should involve a discussion of rolling dice and flipping coins. Let’s imagine a simple “experiment”: we’re holding 20 identical six-sided dice. There’s a picture of a skull on one face of each die; the other five faces are all blank. If we roll all 20 dice, what’s the probability of getting exactly 4 skulls? Assuming that the dice are fair, we know that the chance of any one die coming up skulls is 1 in 6; to say this another way, the skull probability for a single die is approximately \\(0.167\\). This is enough information to answer our question, so let’s have a look at how it’s done. As usual, we’ll want to introduce some names and some notation. We’ll let \\(N\\) denote the number of dice rolls in our experiment, which is often referred to as the size parameter of our binomial distribution. We’ll also use \\(\\theta\\) to refer to the probability that a single die comes up skulls, a quantity that is usually called the success probability of the binomial.21 Finally, we’ll use \\(X\\) to refer to the results of our experiment, namely the number of skulls we get when rolling the dice. Since the actual value of \\(X\\) is due to chance, we refer to it as a random variable. In any case, now that we have all this terminology and notation, we can use it to state the problem a little more precisely. The quantity that we want to calculate is the probability that \\(X = 4\\) given that we know that \\(\\theta = .167\\) and \\(N=20\\). The general “form” of the thing could be written as \\[ P(X \\ | \\ \\theta, N) \\] and we’re interested in the special case where \\(X=4\\), \\(\\theta = 0.167\\) and \\(N=20\\). There’s only one more piece of notation. If we want to say that \\(X\\) is generated randomly from a binomial distribution with parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(N\\), the notation is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(\\theta, N) \\] Yeah, yeah. I know what you’re thinking: notation, notation, notation. Really, who cares? Very few readers of this book are here for the notation, so we should probably move on and talk about how to use the binomial distribution. We’ve included the formula for the binomial distribution in Table 6.2, since some readers may want to play with it themselves, but since most people probably don’t care that much and because we don’t need the formula in this book, let’s not talk about it in any detail. Instead, let’s just see what the binomial distribution looks like. To that end, Figure 6.3 plots the binomial probabilities for all possible values of \\(X\\) for our dice rolling experiment, from \\(X=0\\) (no skulls) all the way up to \\(X=20\\) (all skulls). Note that this is basically a bar chart, and is no different to the “pants probability” plot in Figure 6.2. On the horizontal axis we have all the possible events, and on the vertical axis we can read off the probability of each of those events. So, the probability of rolling 4 skulls out of 20 times is about 0.20 (the actual answer is 0.2022036). In other words, you’d expect that to happen about 20% of the times you repeated this experiment. Table 6.2: Formulas for the binomial and normal distributions. We don’t use these formulas for anything in this book, but they’re pretty important for more advanced work. In the equation for the binomial, \\(X!\\) is the factorial function (i.e., multiply all whole numbers from 1 to \\(X\\)), and for the normal distribution “exp” refers to the exponential function, which we discussed in the Chapter on Data Handling. If these equations don’t make a lot of sense to you, don’t worry too much about them. Binomial Normal \\(P(X | \\theta, N) = \\displaystyle\\frac{N!}{X! (N-X)!} \\theta^X (1-\\theta)^{N-X}\\) \\(p(X | \\mu, \\sigma) = \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(X - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\\) Figure 6.3: The binomial distribution with size parameter of \\(N=20\\) and an underlying success probability of \\(theta = 1/6\\). Each vertical bar depicts the probability of one specific outcome (i.e., one possible value of \\(X\\)). Because this is a probability distribution, each of the probabilities must be a number between 0 and 1, and the heights of the bars must sum to 1 as well. 6.4.2 The normal distribution While the binomial distribution is conceptually the simplest distribution to understand, it’s not the most important one. That particular honour goes to the normal distribution, which is also referred to as “the bell curve” or “Gaussian distribution”. A normal distribution is described using two parameters, the mean of the distribution \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation of the distribution \\(\\sigma\\). The notation that we sometimes use to say that a variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma) \\] Of course, that’s just notation. It doesn’t tell us anything interesting about the normal distribution itself. As was the case with the binomial distribution, the formula for the normal distribution in this book is tucked away in Table 6.2. Instead of focusing on the maths, let’s try to understand what it means for a variable to be normally distributed. To that end, have a look at Figure 6.4, which plots a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1\\). You can see where the name “bell curve” comes from: it looks a bit like a bell. Notice that, unlike the plots to illustrate the binomial distribution, the picture of the normal distribution in Figure 6.4 shows a smooth curve instead of “histogram-like” bars. This isn’t an arbitrary choice: the normal distribution is continuous, whereas the binomial is discrete. For instance, in the die rolling example from the last section, it was possible to get 3 skulls or 4 skulls, but impossible to get 3.9 skulls. The figures in the previous section reflected this fact: in Figure 6.3, for instance, there’s a bar located at \\(X=3\\) and another one at \\(X=4\\), but there’s nothing in between. Continuous quantities don’t have this constraint. For instance, suppose we’re talking about the weather. The temperature on a pleasant Spring day could be 23 degrees, 24 degrees, 23.9 degrees, or anything in between since temperature is a continuous variable, and so a normal distribution might be quite appropriate for describing Spring temperatures.22 Figure 6.4: The normal distribution with mean \\(mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma = 1\\). The \\(x\\)-axis corresponds to the value of some variable, and the \\(y\\)-axis tells us something about how likely we are to observe that value. However, notice that the \\(y\\)-axis is labelled “Probability Density” and not “Probability”. There is a subtle and somewhat frustrating characteristic of continuous distributions that makes the \\(y\\) axis behave a bit oddly: the height of the curve here isn’t actually the probability of observing a particular \\(x\\) value. On the other hand, it is true that the heights of the curve tells you which \\(x\\) values are more likely (the higher ones!). With this in mind, let’s see if we can’t get an intuition for how the normal distribution works. Firstly, let’s have a look at what happens when we play around with the parameters of the distribution. To that end, Figure 6.5 plots normal distributions that have different means, but have the same standard deviation. As you might expect, all of these distributions have the same “width”. The only difference between them is that they’ve been shifted to the left or to the right. In every other respect, they’re identical. In contrast, if we increase the standard deviation while keeping the mean constant, the peak of the distribution stays in the same place, but the distribution gets wider, as you can see in Figure 6.6. Notice, though, that when we widen the distribution, the height of the peak shrinks. This has to happen: in the same way that the heights of the bars that we used to draw a discrete binomial distribution have to sum to 1, the total area under the curve for the normal distribution must equal 1. Figure 6.5: An illustration of what happens when you change the mean of a normal distribution. The solid line depicts a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=4\\). The dashed line shows a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=7\\). In both cases, the standard deviation is \\(sigma=1\\). Not surprisingly, the two distributions have the same shape, but the dashed line is shifted to the right. Figure 6.6: An illustration of what happens when you change the the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Both distributions plotted in this figure have a mean of \\(mu = 5\\), but they have different standard deviations. The solid line plots a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\), and the dashed line shows a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma = 2\\). As a consequence, both distributions are “centred” on the same spot, but the dashed line is wider than the solid one. Before moving on, there is one important characteristic of the normal distribution to point out. Irrespective of the actual mean and standard deviation, 68.3% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Similarly, 95.4% of the distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the distribution is within 3 standard deviations. This idea is illustrated in Figures 6.7 and 6.8. Figure 6.7: The area under the curve tells you the probability that an observation falls within a particular range. The solid lines plot normal distributions with mean \\(mu=0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\) The shaded areas illustrate “areas under the curve” for two important cases. On the left, we can see that there is a 68.3% chance that an observation will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. On the right, we see that there is a 95.4% chance that an observation will fall within two standard deviations of the mean Figure 6.8: Two more examples of the “area under the curve idea”. There is a 15.9% chance that an observation is one standard deviation below the mean or smaller (left), and a 34.1% chance that the observation is greater than one standard deviation below the mean but still below the mean (right). Notice that if you add these two numbers together you get 15.9% + 34.1% = 50%. For normally distributed data, there is a 50% chance that an observation falls below the mean. And of course that also implies that there is a 50% chance that it falls above the mean. 6.4.3 Probability density There’s something we missed throughout the discussion of the normal distribution, something that some introductory textbooks omit completely. Fortunately, it’s not something that you need to understand at a deep level in order to do basic statistics: rather, it’s something that starts to become important later on when you move beyond the basics. So, if it doesn’t make complete sense, don’t worry: try to make sure that you follow the gist of it. There have been one or two things that don’t quite make sense. Perhaps you noticed that the \\(y\\)-axis in these figures is labelled “Probability Density” rather than density. Maybe you noticed that we used \\(p(X)\\) instead of \\(P(X)\\) when giving the formula for the normal distribution. Let us spend a little time thinking about what it really means to say that \\(X\\) is a continuous variable. Let’s say we’re talking about the temperature outside. The thermometer tells me it’s 23 degrees, but we know that’s not really true. It’s not exactly 23 degrees. Maybe it’s 23.1 degrees. But we know that that’s not really true either, because it might actually be 23.09 degrees. But, we know that… well, you get the idea. The tricky thing with genuinely continuous quantities is that you never really know exactly what they are. Now think about what this implies when we talk about probabilities. Suppose that tomorrow’s maximum temperature is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 23 and standard deviation 1. What’s the probability that the temperature will be exactly 23 degrees? The answer is “zero”, or possibly, “a number so close to zero that it might as well be zero”. Why is this? It’s like trying to throw a dart at an infinitely small dart board: no matter how good your aim, you’ll never hit it. In real life, you’ll never get a value of exactly 23. It’ll always be something like 23.1 or 22.99998 or something. In other words, it’s completely meaningless to talk about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees. However, in everyday language, if we say that it was 23 degrees outside and turned out to be 22.9998 degrees, you probably wouldn’t make a fuss. Because in everyday language, “23 degrees” usually means something like “somewhere between 22.5 and 23.5 degrees”. And while it doesn’t feel very meaningful to ask about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees, it does seem sensible to ask about the probability that the temperature lies between 22.5 and 23.5, or between 20 and 30, or any other range of temperatures. The point of this discussion is to make clear that, when we’re talking about continuous distributions, it’s not meaningful to talk about the probability of a specific value. However, what we can talk about is the probability that the value lies within a particular range of values. To find out the probability associated with a particular range, what you need to do is calculate the “area under the curve”. We’ve seen this concept already: in Figure 6.7, the shaded areas shown depict genuine probabilities (e.g., in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.7, it shows the probability of observing a value that falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean). Okay, so that explains part of the story. We’ve explained a little bit about how continuous probability distributions should be interpreted (i.e., the area under the curve is the key thing), but we haven’t actually explained what the formula for \\(p(x)\\) actually means. Obviously, \\(p(x)\\) doesn’t describe a probability, but what is it? The name for this quantity \\(p(x)\\) is a probability density, and in terms of the plots we’ve been drawing, it corresponds to the height of the curve. The densities themselves aren’t meaningful in and of themselves: but they’re “rigged” to ensure that the area under the curve is always interpretable as genuine probabilities. To be honest, that’s about as much as you really need to know for now. For those readers who know a little calculus, let’s give a slightly more precise explanation. In the same way that probabilities are non-negative numbers that must sum to 1, probability densities are non-negative numbers that must integrate to 1 (where the integral is taken across all possible values of \\(X\\)). To calculate the probability that \\(X\\) falls between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we calculate the definite integral of the density function over the corresponding range, \\(\\int_a^b p(x) \\ dx\\). If you don’t remember or never learned calculus, don’t worry about this. It’s not needed for this book. 6.4.4 Other useful distributions The normal distribution is the distribution that statistics makes the most use of (for reasons to be discussed shortly), and the binomial distribution is handy for many purposes. But the world of statistics is filled with probability distributions, some of which we’ll run into in passing. In particular, the three that will appear in this book are the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. We won’t give formulas for any of these or talk about them in too much detail, but we will show you some pictures. The \\(t\\) distribution is a continuous distribution that looks very similar to a normal distribution but has heavier tails: see Figure 6.9. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you don’t know the mean or standard deviation. We’ll run into this distribution again in Chapter ??. Figure 6.9: A \\(t\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (solid line). It looks similar to a normal distribution, but it’s not quite the same. For comparison purposes, we’ve plotted a standard normal distribution as the dashed line. Note that the “tails” of the \\(t\\) distribution are “heavier” (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution? That’s the important difference between the two. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is another distribution that turns up in lots of different places. The situation in which we’ll see it is when doing categorical data analysis (Chapter ??), but it’s one of those things that actually pops up all over the place. When you dig into the maths (and who doesn’t love doing that?), it turns out that the main reason why the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution turns up all over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred to as taking a “sum of squares”), this sum has a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. You’d be amazed how often this fact turns out to be useful. Anyway, here’s what a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution looks like: Figure 6.10. Figure 6.10: A \\(chi^2\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. Notice that the observed values must always be greater than zero, and that the distribution is pretty skewed. These are the key features of a chi-square distribution. The \\(F\\) distribution looks a bit like a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution, and it arises whenever you need to compare two \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions to one another. Admittedly, this doesn’t exactly sound like something that any sane person would want to do, but it turns out to be very important in real-world data analysis. Remember when we said that \\(\\chi^2\\) turns out to be the key distribution when we’re taking a “sum of squares”? Well, what that means is if you want to compare two different “sums of squares”, you’re probably talking about something that has an \\(F\\) distribution. Of course, we still haven’t given you an example of anything involving a sum of squares, but we will in Chapter ??. And that’s where we’ll run into the \\(F\\) distribution. Oh, and here’s a picture: Figure 6.11. Figure 6.11: An \\(F\\) distribution with 3 and 5 degrees of freedom. Qualitatively speaking, it looks pretty similar to a chi-square distribution, but they’re not quite the same in general. They’re all continuous distributions, and they’re all closely related to the normal distribution. The key thing for our purposes, however, is not that you have a deep understanding of all these different distributions, nor that you remember the precise relationships between them. The main thing is that you grasp the basic idea that these distributions are all deeply related to one another and to the normal distribution. Later on, we’re going to run into data that are normally distributed or at least assumed to be normally distributed. What you have to understand right now is that if you make the assumption that your data are normally distributed, you shouldn’t be surprised to see \\(\\chi^2\\), \\(t\\) and \\(F\\) distributions popping up all over the place when you start trying to do your data analysis. 6.5 Summary In this chapter we’ve talked about probability. We’ve talked what probability means, and why statisticians can’t agree on what it means. We talked about the rules that probabilities have to obey. And we introduced the idea of a probability distribution, and we spent a good portion of the chapter talking about some of the more important probability distributions that statisticians work with. The section by section breakdown looks like this: Probability theory versus statistics (Section 6.1) Frequentist versus Bayesian views of probability (Section 6.2) Basics of probability theory (Section 6.3) Binomial distribution (Section 6.4.1), normal distribution (Section 6.4.2), and others (Section 6.4.4) Many undergraduate psychology classes on statistics skim over this content very quickly, and even the more advanced courses will often “forget” to revisit the basic foundations of the field. Most academic psychologists would not know the difference between probability and density; until recently, very few would have been aware of the difference between Bayesian and frequentist probability. However, it’s essential to understand these things before moving on to the applications. For example, there are a lot of rules about what you’re “allowed” to say when making statistical inferences, and many of these can seem arbitrary and weird. However, they start to make sense if you understand this Bayesian/frequentist distinction. Similarly, in Chapter ?? we’re going to talk about something called the \\(t\\)-test, and if you really want to have a grasp of the mechanics of the \\(t\\)-test it really helps to have a sense of what a \\(t\\)-distribution actually looks like. You get the idea. This doesn’t mean that frequentists can’t make hypothetical statements, of course; it’s just that if you want to make a statement about probability, then it must be possible to redescribe that statement in terms of a sequence of potentially observable events, and the relative frequencies of different outcomes that appear within that sequence.↩︎ Note that the term “success” is pretty arbitrary and doesn’t actually imply that the outcome is something to be desired. If \\(\\theta\\) referred to the probability that any one passenger gets injured in a bus crash, it is still called the success probability.↩︎ In practice, the normal distribution is so handy that people tend to use it even when the variable isn’t actually continuous. As long as there are enough categories (e.g., Likert scale responses to a questionnaire), it’s pretty standard practice to use the normal distribution as an approximation. This works out much better in practice than you’d think.↩︎ "],["hypothesis-testing.html", "Chapter 7 Hypothesis testing", " Chapter 7 Hypothesis testing "],["references.html", "References", " References Adair, G.
