The curse of belief bias The Simpson’s paradox – A cautionary tale Statistics in psychology There’s more to research methods than statistics", " Chapter 1 Why do we learn statistics? To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favourite part of one’s psychological education. Not surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn’t happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. Why do you do statistics? Why don’t scientists just use common sense? The best answer is a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach is likely to work. The curse of belief bias Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. Psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the belief bias effect in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn’t. For instance, here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it’s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that’s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand: an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesn’t have to involve true statements. On the other hand, here’s an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn’t, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We’d expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, you’d expect to see data like this: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 100% say “valid” 100% say “valid” argument is invalid 0% say “valid” 0% say “valid” If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That is, it’d be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff. In a classic study, Evans et al. (1983) ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure of the data, everything went the way you’d hope: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” argument is invalid 8% say “valid” Not perfect, but that’s pretty good. But look what happens when our intuitive feelings about the truth of the conclusion run against the logical structure of the argument: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” 46% say “valid” argument is invalid 92% say “valid” 8% say “valid” Apparently, when people are presented with a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see that the argument is weak. It’s just too easy for us to “believe what we want to believe”; so if we want to “believe in the data” instead, we’re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control. That’s what statistics does: it helps keep us honest. The Simpson’s paradox – A cautionary tale In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the problem was that the gender breakdown of their admissions, which looked like this: Number of applicants Percent admitted Males 8442 46% Females 4321 35% Given that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a coincidence. When people started looking more carefully at the admissions data (Bickel et al., 1975) on a department by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants. Table 1.1 shows the admission figures for the six largest departments: Table 1.1: Admission figures for the six largest departments by gender Department Male Applicants Male Percent Admitted Female Applicants Female Percent admitted A 825 62% 108 82% B 560 63% 25 68% C 325 37% 593 34% D 417 33% 375 35% E 191 28% 393 24% F 272 6% 341 7% Remarkably, most departments had a higher rate of admissions for females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How can both of these statements be true at the same time? Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., engineering, chemistry) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., English) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get A&gt;B&gt;D&gt;C&gt;F&gt;E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C&gt;E&gt;D&gt;F&gt;A&gt;B. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And in fact, if we look at all Figure 1.1 we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as Simpson’s paradox. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real. When doing research, there are lots of subtle, counterintuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. Truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data. Figure 1.1: The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from Bickel et al. (1975). Circles plot departments with more than 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of applicants. The crosses plot department with fewer than 40 applicants. Statistics only solves part of the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the “aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department (and there are good reasons to do that), and at the level of individual departments, the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce. If we’re interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in the disaggregated data. In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data, no more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but there’s no substitute for careful thought. Statistics in psychology We hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But we’re guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So here’s an attempt to answer a few of them… Why does psychology have so much statistics? The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. There’s a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment”. The “things” that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy people. The “things” of physics include object like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set. We teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. Can’t someone else do the statistics? To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. There’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics: Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at least understand the basics of stats. Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics. Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. In almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you have to be self-sufficient. Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics. I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics? Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone: we live in the 21st century, and data are everywhere. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section… There’s more to research methods than statistics Most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. Most student fears relate to the statistics part of the course. Hopefully you are convinced that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent. But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. We really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class.

It won’t give you enough information to design studies of your own, but it will provide you with a lot of the essential tools you need to assess the studies done by other people. Since this book focuses more on data analysis than data collection, this only gives a very brief overview. This chapter relies heavily on Campbell &amp; Stanley (1963) for discussing study design and Stevens (1946) for discussing scales of measurement. 3.1 Introduction to psychological measurement First, data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, what we’re trying to do here is measure something about human behaviour or the human mind. What do we mean by “measurement”? 3.1.1 Some thoughts about psychological measurement Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, labels, or other well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement: Danielle’s age is 33 years. She does not like anchovies. Her chromosomal gender is male. Her self-identified gender is female. In the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicised part is “the measurement itself”. We can expand on this a little bit by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case: Age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what the age could be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice, you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150 since no human has ever lived that long. When asked if someone likes anchovies, they might say I do, I do not, I have no opinion, or I sometimes do. Chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. With Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), it is more similar to male than to female. And there are other possibilities, too. Self-identified gender is also very likely to be male or female, transgender, nonbinary, queer etc. As you can see, for some things (like age), it seems pretty apparent what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas, for other things, it gets a bit tricky. But even regarding someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, if you’re a developmental psychologist, measuring in years is way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t all that precise. Generally, when we say “age”, we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only significant point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In a sense, yes. By social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientific perspective, that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often helpful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception. From that perspective, Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. It won’t make much difference when dealing with adults, but when dealing with newborns, it might. In other words, how you specify the allowable measurement values is important. Still, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” will you use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities: You could just ask people, “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age. You could ask an authority (e.g. a parent), “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and it’s not all that hard when dealing with kids since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception” since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. You might need a different authority (e.g. an obstetrician). You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time-consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g. if the person is now dead). 3.1.2 Operationalisation: defining your measurement All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of operationalisation. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalisation is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept and turn it into an accurate measurement. The method of operationalisation can involve several different things: Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research? Determining what method you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question? Defining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? The values aren’t numerical for other types of measurements (e.g. gender). But, as before, we need to consider what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options do we allow them to choose from? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal responses, how will you interpret their answers? Operationalisation is tricky, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. How you operationalise the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. You’ll often find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through case-by-case. Nevertheless, while there are a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general. Before moving on, let’s take a moment to clear up our terminology and, in the process, introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other: A theoretical construct. This is the thing that you’re trying to measure, like “age”, “gender”, or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re a bit vague. A measure. The measure refers to the method or tool used to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure. An operationalisation. The term “operationalisation” refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct or the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct. A variable. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” we end up with in our data sets. In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to understand the differences. 3.2 Scales of measurement As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s handy to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement. 3.2.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities: for these kinds of variables, it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is “bigger’ or”better” than any other one, and it doesn’t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel bizarre to talk about an “average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it. Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose we were researching how people commute to and from work. One variable we would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when we ask 100 people how they got to work today, we get this: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which the options are listed isn’t very exciting. We could have chosen to display the data like this: Transportation Number of people (3) Car 48 (1) Train 12 (4) Bicycle 10 (2) Bus 30 – and nothing really changes. 3.2.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. Consequently, we know that 1st &gt; 2nd, and 2nd &gt; 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. Here’s a more psychologically exciting example. Suppose we’re interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and we ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a suitable match, statement 3 isn’t a perfect match, and statement 4 strongly opposes science. So, in terms of the thing we’re interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), we can order the items as 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4. Since this ordering exists, it would be peculiar to list the options like this: Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are not rising Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why – because it seems to violate the natural “structure” of the question. So, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions and got the following answers: Response Number (1) Temperatures are rising because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can’t do is average them. For instance, in our simple example here, the “average” response to the question is 1.97. We would love to know if someone can tell us what that means. 3.2.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees Celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between 7\\(^\\circ\\) and 10\\(^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables.5 However, notice that the 0\\(^\\circ\\) does not mean “no temperature at all”: it means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as 10\\(^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to claim that 20\\(^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as -10\\(^\\circ\\). Again, let us look at a more psychological example. Suppose we’re interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. We will want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all. 3.2.4 Ratio scale The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In many tasks, it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take 3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8 seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here: Ben took 3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35 times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And you can do this because, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really means “no time at all”. 3.2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle. These definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in-between by taking 3.0 seconds. And, of course, it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice, it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in-between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees Celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table 3.1 summarises the relationship between the measurement scales and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. Some textbooks get this wrong, and people often say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very unfortunate. Table 3.1: The relationship between the measurement scales and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. continuous discrete nominal \\(\\checkmark\\) ordinal \\(\\checkmark\\) interval \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) ratio \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 3.2.6 Some complexities: the Likert scale Okay, I know you’ll be shocked to hear this, but the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life fall into these neat categories, so you need to be careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is all survey designs’ bread and butter tool. You have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” … and then, the options presented to the participant are these: Strongly disagree Disagree Neither agree nor disagree Agree Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case, 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfect example of a 5-point Likert scale too: Strongly disagree Strongly agree Likert scales are convenient, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale since the items are ordered, and they’re not ratio scale either since there’s no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life, it’s pretty apparent they’re not the same. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice, most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice, it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. 3.3 Assessing the reliability of a measurement At this point, we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalise a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. We’ve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. Reliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of our weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if we step on and off the scales repeatedly, it’ll keep giving us the same answer. Measuring our intelligence by means of “asking our mum” is very unreliable. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to its validity). If we’re holding a sack of potatoes when we step on and off bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give us the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match our true weight at all; therefore, it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, while our mum’s estimate of our intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. So that would be an unreliable but valid measure. To some extent, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes, so much so that many would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity. Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability: Test-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get the same answer? Inter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g. someone else rates our intelligence), will they produce the same answer? Parallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if we use a different set of bathroom scales to measure our weight, does it give the same answer? Internal consistency reliability. Suppose a measurement is constructed from many different parts that perform similar functions (e.g. a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions). Do the individual parts tend to give similar answers? Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that Danielle teaches, Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam, several questions are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes, so the exam on its own has a relatively high internal consistency, which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability when you want to measure the same thing! 3.4 The “role” of variables: predictors and outcomes We’ve got one last piece of terminology that needs to be explained before moving away from variables. Usually, when we do some research, we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data, we typically try to explain some of the variables in terms of the other variables. It’s essential to keep the two roles, “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained”, distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables since it’s going to happen repeatedly. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable \\(Y\\), and the variables “doing the explaining” as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc. Now, when we are doing analysis, we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable you use to explain (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study “properly”, then \\(X\\) isn’t dependent on anything else. However, those names are horrible: they’re hard to remember, and they’re highly misleading because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. And, because we’re not the only people who think that IV and DV are just awful names, there are several alternatives that some find more appealing. The terms used in these notes are predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that you’re trying to use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes). This is summarised in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. Note that this book will tend to avoid the classical terminology in favour of the newer names. role of the variable classical name modern name to be explained dependent variable (DV) outcome to do the explaining independent variable (IV) predictor 3.5 Experimental and non-experimental research One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between “experimental research” and “non-experimental research”. When we make this distinction, what we’re really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study. 3.5.1 Experimental research The key feature of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (IVs) and then allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs) to see if they have any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that there’s no chance that something other than the predictor variables is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way “balanced” to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is randomisation: that is, we randomly assign people to different groups and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). We’ll talk more about randomisation later in this course. Still, for now, it’s enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise (but not eliminate) the chances that there is any systematic difference between groups. Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters: for instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, not by smoking per se. In technical terms, these other things (e.g. diet) are called “confounds”, and we’ll talk about those in just a moment. In the meantime, let’s now consider what a good experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, suppose we randomly divide participants into two groups and force half of them to become smokers. In that case, it’s doubtful that the groups will differ in any respect other than half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers. 3.5.2 Non-experimental research Non-experimental research is a broad term that covers “any study in which the researcher doesn’t have quite as much control as they do in an experiment”. Control is something that scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates, there are many situations in which you can’t or shouldn’t try to obtain that control. Since it’s grossly unethical (and almost undoubtedly criminal) to force people to smoke to find out if they get cancer, this is an excellent example of a situation where you shouldn’t try to obtain experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our “smoking experiment” does have a few other issues. For instance, when we suggested that we “force” half of the people to become smokers, we must have been talking about starting with a sample of non-smokers and then forcing them to become smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets and also suppose that people who usually smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the “smokers” in our experiment aren’t “natural” smokers (i.e. we forced non-smokers to become smokers; they didn’t take on all of the other normal, real-life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess), they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example, they wouldn’t get lung cancer, and our experiment will fail because it violates the structure of the “natural” world (the technical name for this is an “artefactual” result; see later). One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between quasi-experimental research and case studies. The example from earlier – in which we wanted to examine the incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers without trying to control who smokes and who doesn’t – is a quasi-experimental design. That is, it’s the same as an experiment, but we don’t control the predictors (IVs). We can still use statistics to analyse the results – it’s just that we have to be a lot more careful. The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a few instances. In general, you can’t use statistics to analyse the results of case studies, and it’s usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about “people in general” from a few isolated examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations where you don’t have any alternative: neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just can’t find a lot of people with brain damage in a specific area, so the only thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much care as you can. However, there are also some genuine advantages to case studies: because you don’t have as many people to study, you have the ability to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We won’t talk much about case studies in these lectures, but they are nevertheless very valuable tools! 3.6 Assessing the validity of a study More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea behind validity is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice, it’s much harder to check validity than to check reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed-upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there are lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises its own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. Let’s talk about five different types: Internal validity External validity Construct validity Face validity Ecological validity To give you a quick guide as to what matters here: Internal and external validity are the most important since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. Construct validity asks whether you’re actually measuring what you think you are. Face validity isn’t terribly important except insofar as you care about “appearances”. Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot. 3.6.1 Internal validity Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able to draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first-year students, ask them to write a 1000-word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except – the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables. 3.6.2 External validity External validity relates to the generalisability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study? To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalise to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity. The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as participants. However, the researchers don’t care only about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always risks lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity. That said, it is absolutely critical to realise that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. The choice of population threatens the external validity: if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g. psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicised part is the bit that many people forget: psychology undergraduates indeed differ from the general population in many ways, so a study that uses only psych students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon you’re studying, there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here are two extreme examples: You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity. You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing: People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life. Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life. 3.6.3 Construct validity Construct validity is a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct and inadequate construct validity if it doesn’t. To give a very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose we’re trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way we attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that we can count them. When we do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So we, therefore, conclude that the proportion of cheaters is 0%. Clearly, this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain construct validity. The problem with the measure is that while we’re trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat”, we’re actually measuring “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody-minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So our study has gone wrong because our measurement has very poor construct validity. 3.6.4 Face validity Face validity simply refers to whether or not a measure “looks like” it’s doing what it’s supposed to, nothing more. If you design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and say, “no, that test doesn’t measure intelligence”, then the measure lacks face validity. It’s as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isn’t very important from a purely scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what it’s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what it’s supposed to do. Consequently, we generally don’t care much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes: Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a “hunch” that a particular measure won’t work. While these hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it’s often worth paying attention to them. Because oftentimes people know they can’t quite verbalise, there might be something to worry about even if you can’t quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticises the face validity of your study, it’s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. If you don’t find any reason for concern, you should probably not worry: after all, face validity doesn’t matter much. (Very) often, completely uninformed people will also have a “hunch” that your research is bollocks. And they’ll criticise it on the internet or something. On close inspection, you’ll often notice that these criticisms are focused entirely on how the study “looks”, but not on anything more profound. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further. Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g. this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policymakers of something or other), then you have to care about face validity. Simply because – whether you like it or not – a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific, psychological grounds, then it won’t matter how good your studies “really” are. If they lack face validity, you’ll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, it’s somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but that’s how things go. 3.6.5 Ecological validity Ecological validity is a different notion of validity, similar to external validity but less important. The idea is that, to be ecologically valid, the entire study set-up should closely approximate the real-world scenario being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity – it relates mostly to whether the study “looks” right, but with a bit more rigour to it. To be ecologically valid, the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It’s no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that it’s much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. A simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with a fairly simple array of faces to look at rather than a lineup. The length of time between seeing the “criminal” and being asked to identify the suspect in the “line up” is usually shorter. The “crime” isn’t real, so there’s no chance that the witness is scared, and there are no police officers present, so there’s not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity. 3.7 Confounds, artefacts and other threats to validity If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are confounds and artefacts. These two terms are defined in the following way: Confound: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable6 that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, if the confounding variable causes it, etc. Artefact: A result is said to be “artefactual” if it only holds in the special situation you tested in your study. The possibility that your result is an artefact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalise your results to the actual population you care about. As a general rule, confounds are a more significant concern for non-experimental studies precisely because they’re not proper experiments. By definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing. However, there are always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artefacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artefactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realise that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds). Still, because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild”, you reduce the chances of getting an artefactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artefact. Be warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artefactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g. see 3.7.5). Okay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterised as a confound or an artefact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples… 3.7.1 History effects History effects refers to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen between a pre-test and a post-test. Or in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects: You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you were still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 expressed quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December. You’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g. by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants. 3.7.2 Maturation effects As with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Instead, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects: When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3-year-olds. One thing you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works. When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment 3.7.3 Repeated testing effects An important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g. anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include: Learning and practice: e.g. “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session. Familiarity with the testing situation: e.g. if people are nervous at time 1, this might make the performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like. Auxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g. if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1. 3.7.4 Selection bias Selection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turn out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males), then you’re in a lot of trouble. 3.7.5 Differential attrition One quite subtle danger to be aware of is called differential attrition, which is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, we manage to find a perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. We start running “our incredibly long and tedious experiment” on our perfect sample, but then, because our study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. We can’t stop this: as we’ll discuss later in the chapter on research ethics, participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers, we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that “our incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high dropout rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this dropout is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly, the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom etc., than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that we care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of our results. When thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example above, the differential attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all the conditions in our experiment at about the same rate. The main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry you’ll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases: in other words, you lose external validity. The second type of differential attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, but you also have to worry about your internal validity too. To see why this is the case, let’s consider a very dumb study in which I want to see if insulting people makes them act more obediently. So, we design our experiment with two conditions. In the “treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less cooperative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this dropout isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be those who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody-minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study, insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient: it makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot. 3.7.6 Non-response bias Non-response bias is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalise from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answered every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem. 3.7.7 Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance. Here’s an example. Say we’re interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psych I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university, even though they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve got a big class, there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark, you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your unique skills, and you have to not make any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the thing: intelligence and hard work are transferrable from one class to the next. Luck isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That’s the very definition of “luck”. The consequence of this is that when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless, those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggest that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse, but after the negative reinforcement, they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should expect (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artefact caused by regression to the mean (see Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973 for discussion). 3.7.8 Experimenter bias Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally influence the experiment results by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not – either the right answer to the questions being asked or knowledge of the expected performance pattern for the condition the participant is in, and so on. The classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907 (Hothersall, 2004; Pfungst, 1911). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count and perform other human-like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs. The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double-blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a good solution to the problem, but it’s essential to recognise that it’s not quite ideal and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that we could try to construct a double-blind study is to have one of the PhD students (one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (us) who knows all the details (e.g. correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the PhD student) doesn’t know anything. Except, that last part is improbable. For the PhD student to run the study effectively, they need to have been briefed by us, the researcher. And as it happens, the PhD student also knows a bit about our general beliefs about people and psychology. As a result of all this, it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid learning a little bit about what expectations we have. And even a little knowledge can have an effect: suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion effect”: if you expect great things of people, they’ll rise to the occasion; but if you expect them to fail, they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 3.7.9 Demand effects and reactivity When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants and that these affect people’s behaviour (Rosenthal, 1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching/studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects. The Hawthorne effect captures the idea that people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago (see Adair, 1984). A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied rather than the lighting. To get a bit more specific about how the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment. Still, it might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world: The good participant tries to be too helpful to the researcher: he or she seeks to figure out the experimenter’s hypotheses and confirm them. The negative participant does the exact opposite of the good participant: he or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way. The faithful participant is unnaturally obedient: he or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting. The apprehensive participant gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural or overly socially desirable. 3.7.10 Placebo effects The placebo effect is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials: if you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t treated at all. In other words, it is people believing that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug. 3.7.11 Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects In some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for “all other threats to external validity”. They refer to the fact that the choice of the subpopulation from which you draw your participants, the location, timing and manner in which you run your study (including who collects the data) and the tools that you use to make your measurements might all be influencing the results. Specifically, the worry is that these things might be influencing the results in such a way that the results won’t generalise to a wider array of people, places and measures. 3.7.12 Fraud, deception and self-deception Textbooks assessing the validity of a study often seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not.7 Not only that, but scientists are not immune to belief bias – it’s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, which can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research, and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally “slanted”. Here’s a list of a few ways in which these issues can arise: Data fabrication. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth and may actually reflect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research). Hoaxes. Hoaxes share many similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There are quite a few well-known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g. Piltdown man). Some were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g. the Sokal affair). Data misrepresentation. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more common in my experience to see data misrepresented. Often the data doesn’t say what the researchers think it says. This isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty, but it’s due to a lack of sophistication in the data analysis. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson’s paradox. It’s very common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind, and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself, you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g. the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There are a lot of variants on this, many of which are very hard to detect. Study “misdesign”. Okay, this one is subtle. The issue here is that a researcher designs a study with built-in flaws, which are never reported in the paper. The data reported are authentic and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect, and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it “easy” to (artefactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this – in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself – is to design an experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be doing and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want, you can add all the trappings of double-blind experimentation etc. It won’t make a difference since the study materials are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results, the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader: what’s obvious to the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way we’ve described this makes it sound like it’s always fraud: probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but the bigger concern has been unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes. And so the study just happens to end up with a built-in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication. Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesising. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less lie about what they found is by engaging in what’s referred to as “data mining”. As we’ll discuss later in the class, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, you’ll eventually find something that “looks” like a real effect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers, it’s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it, the bigger the risk you’re taking. The wrong thing is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher runs every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data to cover up the data mining. To be clear: it’s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data and to reanalyse it using your new “post hoc” hypotheses. What is wrong is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done so. If you acknowledge that you did it, then other researchers are able to take your behaviour into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behaviour deceptive. Publication bias &amp; self-censoring. Finally, a pervasive bias is the “non-reporting” of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every article submitted to them: they prefer to publish articles that find “something”. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity 8. This is an example of a publication bias: since no one ever published the 19 studies that didn’t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers “internalise” this bias and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of Danielle’s says, “for every experiment that you get published, you also have ten failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up), others might be genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good” experiment – and telling which is which, is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by Ioannidis (2005) with the depressing title “Why most published research findings are false”. We’d also suggest taking a look at work by Kühberger et al. (2014) presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology. There’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. It’s the obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren’t usually that naive, but for some reason, the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype. 3.8 Summary This chapter isn’t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological research methods: it would require another volume just as long as this one does justice to the topic. However, in real life, statistics and study design are tightly intertwined, so discussing some key topics is convenient. In this chapter, we’ve briefly discussed the following: Introduction to psychological measurement. What does it mean to operationalise a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements? Scales of measurement and types of variables. Remember that there are two different distinctions here: there’s the difference between discrete and continuous data, and there’s the difference between the four different scale types (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio). Reliability of a measurement. If I measure the “same” thing twice, should I expect the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the “same” thing? Well, that’s why we have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are. Terminology: predictors and outcomes. What roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc. Experimental and non-experimental research designs. What makes an experiment an experiment? Is it a nice white lab coat, or does it have something to do with researcher control over variables? Validity and its threats. Does your study measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of research methodology. This chapter is built from the classic little book by Campbell &amp; Stanley (1963), but there are, of course, a large number of textbooks out there on research design. Spend a few minutes with your favourite search engine, and you’ll find dozens. Actually, temperature isn’t strictly an interval scale, in the sense that the amount of energy required to heat something up by 3\\(^\\circ\\) depends on its current temperature. So in the sense that physicists care about, temperature isn’t actually an interval scale.↩︎ The reason why we say that it’s unmeasured is that if you have measured it, then you can use some fancy statistical tricks to deal with the confound. Because of the existence of these statistical solutions to the problem of confounds, we often refer to a confound that we have measured and dealt with as a covariate. Dealing with covariates is a topic for a more advanced course, but it’s comforting to know that it exists.↩︎ Some people might argue that if you’re not honest then you’re not a real scientist. That does have some truth, but that’s disingenuous (google the “No true Scotsman” fallacy). The fact is that there are lots of people who are employed ostensibly as scientists, and whose work has all of the trappings of science, but who are outright fraudulent. Pretending that they don’t exist by saying that they’re not scientists is just childish.↩︎ Clearly, the real effect is that only insane people would even try to read Finnegans Wake.↩︎ "],["exploringavariable.html", "Chapter 4 Exploring a single variable 4.1 Measures of central tendency 4.2 Measures of variability 4.3 Skewness and kurtosis 4.4 Summary: descriptives", " Chapter 4 Exploring a single variable Any time you get a new data set to look at, one of the first things you might want to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what descriptive statistics (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people, the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics. The first dataset we’ll be looking at is real data relating to the Australian Football League (AFL)9. To do this, let us load the aflsmall.Rdata file. Figure 4.1: This is what you would see after loading the dataset. CogStat will help you get familiar with some essential aspects of your variable, like: measures of central tendency (mean, median) measures of variability (range, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, quartiles) measures of “distortion” (skewness, kurtosis). These will help you contextualise the results so the conclusions drawn from the variable will be valid. To start understanding a variable, select Explore variable so a pop-up appears. Move the name of the data you wish to analyse (in this case: afl.margins) from Available variables to Selected variables, then click OK (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Explore variable dialogue. Figure 4.3: This is the first chart you will see exploring the raw shape of the data. The first piece of information here is \\(N\\), which we will use to refer to the number of observations we’re analysing. CogStat (or any other software for that matter) will only use valid data for calculations. Sometimes, mainly when working with survey data, you will have missing data points, the number of which you might have to mention in your written analysis. CogStat will quote these for you: N of valid cases: 176 N of missing cases: 0 Figure 4.4: Scrolling down, you’ll see CogStat reporting all the descriptive measures while showing you a histogram to understand the shape of your data better. Drawing pictures of the data is an excellent way to convey the gist of what the data is trying to tell you; it’s often instrumental to try to condense the data into a few simple summary statistics. In the rest of this chapter, we will explore what these measures mean and what they indicate. 4.1 Measures of central tendency In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want to calculate is a measure of central tendency. That is, you’d like to know something about the “average” or “middle” of your data lies. 4.1.1 The mean The mean of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned (arithmetic) average: add all of the values up and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32 (which CogStat will quote to you when loading the data, see Figure 4.1), so the mean of these observations is just: \\[ \\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \\frac{183}{5} = 36.60 \\] Of course, this definition of the mean isn’t news to anyone: averages (i.e. means) are used so often in everyday life that this is quite familiar. We used \\(N\\) to denote the number of observations. Now let’s attach a label to the observations themselves. It’s traditional to use \\(X\\) for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we’re actually talking about. That is, we’ll use \\(X_1\\) to refer to the first observation, \\(X_2\\) to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to \\(X_N\\) for the last one. The following table lists the 5 observations in the afl.margins variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to: the observation its symbol the observed value winning margin, game 1 \\(X_1\\) 56 points winning margin, game 2 \\(X_2\\) 31 points winning margin, game 3 \\(X_3\\) 56 points winning margin, game 4 \\(X_4\\) 8 points winning margin, game 5 \\(X_5\\) 32 points Okay, now let’s try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use \\(\\bar{X}\\) as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N} \\] This formula is entirely correct, but it’s terribly long, so we make use of the summation symbol \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) to shorten it.10 If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, \\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\\) or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i \\] Taken literally, this could be read as “the sum, taken over all \\(i\\) values from 1 to 5, of the value \\(X_i\\)”. But basically, what it means is “add up the first five observations”. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\] In all honesty, all this mathematical notation is just a fancy way of laying out the same things said in words: add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items. The goal here was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we’ll be using throughout the book: \\(\\bar{X}\\) for the mean, \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) for the idea of summation, \\(X_i\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation, and \\(N\\) for the total number of observations. We’re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so you must understand them well enough to be able to “read” the equations and to be able to see what they’re really saying. CogStat calculates the mean automatically when exploring a variable using all valid data points, not just the first five. It will be part of the Descriptives for the variable section, as seen in Figure 4.4. The result for our variable is: afl.margins Mean 35.3 4.1.2 The median The second measure of central tendency people use a lot is the median, and it’s even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value11. As before, let’s imagine we were interested only in the first 5 AFL winning margins: 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order: \\[ 8, 31, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] From inspection, it’s evident that the median value of these five observations is 32 since that’s the middle one in the sorted list. Easy stuff. But what should we do if we were interested in the first six games rather than the first 5? Since the sixth game in the season had a winning margin of 14 points, our sorted list is now \\[ 8, 14, \\mathbf{31}, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] and there are two middle numbers, 31 and 32. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is 31.5. In the data set we loaded to CogStat, there were 176 valid cases, so we ought to have two middle numbers. The result in this case is (as seen in Figure 4.4): afl.margins Median 30.5 4.1.3 Mean or median? What’s the difference? Figure 4.5: An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the “centre of gravity” of the data set: if you imagine that the histogram of the data is a solid object, then the point on which you could balance it (as if on a see-saw) is the mean. In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger. Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, what that implies, and which one to choose. This is illustrated in Figure 4.5; the mean is kind of like the “centre of gravity” of the data set, whereas the median is the “middle value” in the data. What this implies about which one you should use depends a little on what type of data you’ve got and what you’re trying to achieve. As a rough guide: If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn’t be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it’s probably best to use the mode (Section 4.1.5) instead. If your data are ordinal scale, you’re more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only uses the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are larger) but doesn’t depend on the precise numbers involved. That’s precisely the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. Conversely, the mean makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it’s not appropriate for ordinal data. For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you’re trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage of using all the information in the data (which is useful when you don’t have a lot of data), but it’s very susceptible to extreme values, as we’ll see in Section 4.1.4. Let’s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section 4.3). This is illustrated in Figure 4.5 notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you’re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here. 4.1.4 Trimmed mean One of the fundamental rules of applied statistics is that the data are messy. Real life is never simple, so the data sets you obtain are never as straightforward as the statistical theory says.12 This can have awkward consequences. To illustrate, consider this rather strange-looking data set: \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] If you were to observe this in a real-life data set, you’d probably suspect that there is something odd about the \\(-100\\) value. It’s probably an outlier, a value that doesn’t belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely. In this particular case, it might be the right call. In real life, however, you don’t always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead: \\[ -15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12 \\] The \\(-15\\) looks suspicious, but not as much as that \\(-100\\) did. In this case, it’s a little trickier. It might be a legitimate observation; it might not. When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values and thus is not considered a robust measure. One remedy that we’ve seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a “trimmed mean”. To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is “discard” the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest) and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median: just like a median, you aren’t highly influenced by extreme outliers, but like the mean, you “use” more than one of the observations. Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observations on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations and the smallest 10% of the observations and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations. Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median. For our toy example above, we have 10 observations. So a 10% trimmed mean is calculated by ignoring the largest value (i.e. \\(12\\)) and the smallest value (i.e. \\(-15\\)) and taking the mean of the remaining values. Mean: 4.1 Median: 5.5 That’s a fairly substantial difference. But the mean is being influenced too much by the extreme values at either end of the data set, especially the \\(-15\\) one. If we take a 10% trimmed mean, we’ll drop the extreme values on either side and take the mean of the rest: Mean: 5.5 Which, in this case, gives exactly the same answer as the median. Currently, there is no direct way for you to do that in CogStat, but you can certainly trim those outlying data points in your source file and re-load the data. 4.1.5 Mode The mode of a sample is straightforward: it is the value that occurs most frequently. In CogStat, you will see a frequency table (Figure 4.6) of the values in your data if you have Frequencies ticked in the Explore variable dialogue. Figure 4.6: The frequency table sorts non-nominal values from lowest to highest. While it’s generally true that the mode is most often calculated when you have nominal scale data – because means and medians are useless for those sorts of variables –, there are some situations in which you do want to know the mode of an ordinal, interval or ratio scale variable. For instance, let’s look at our afl.margins variable we loaded into CogStat. This variable is clearly ratio scale, and so in most situations the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario… a friend of yours is offering a bet. They pick a football game at random, and (without knowing who is playing) you have to guess the exact margin. If you guess correctly, you win $50. If you don’t, you lose $1. There are no consolation prizes for “almost” getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin13 For this bet, the mean and the median are completely useless to you. It is the mode that you should bet on. So, we look at the frequency table offered by the result set: the data suggest you should bet on a \\(3.0\\) point margin, and since this was observed in 8 of the 176 games (4.5% of games – the relative frequency), the odds are firmly in your favour. 4.2 Measures of variability The statistics that we’ve discussed so far all relate to central tendency. They all talk about which values are “in the middle” or “popular” in the data. However, central tendency is not the only type of summary statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the variability of the data. That is, how “spread out” are the data? How “far” away from the mean or median do the observed values tend to be? For now, let’s assume that the data are interval or ratio scale, so we’ll continue to use the afl.margins data. We’ll use this data to discuss several different measures of spread, each with different strengths and weaknesses. 4.2.1 Range The range of a variable is very simple: it’s the largest value minus the smallest value. For the AFL winning margins data, the maximum value is \\(116\\), and the minimum is \\(0\\), so the range is: \\[116-0=\\mathbf{116}\\] CogStat automatically calculates all these values (see Figure 4.4), so there is nothing we need to do about this, only to understand what it implies. Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of “variability”, it’s one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it, we’d like our statistics not to be unduly influenced by these cases. Let us look once again at our toy example of a data set containing very extreme outliers: \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] It is clear that the range is not robust since this has a range of \\(110\\), but if the outlier was removed, we would have a range of only \\(8\\). 4.2.2 Interquartile range The interquartile range (IQR) is like the range, but instead of calculating the difference between the largest and smallest value, it calculates the difference between the 25th and 75th quantile. Probably you already know what a quantile is (or more commonly called percentile), but if not: the 10th percentile of a data set is the smallest number \\(x\\) such that 10% of the data is less than \\(x\\). In fact, we’ve already come across the idea: the median of a data set is its 50th quantile/percentile! Quartile is another specific term used for the 25th (lower), 50th (median), and 75th (upper) percentile, as it is splitting the data set into four (hence ‘quart-’) equal parts.14 CogStat provides you with both the 25th (Lower quartile) and 75th quantiles (Upper quartile): Upper quartile: 50.5 Lower quartile: 12.8 We can see that the interquartile range for the 2010 AFL winning margins data is: \\[ 50.5 - 12.8 = \\mathbf{37.7} \\] While it’s obvious how to interpret the range, it’s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the “middle half” of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile, one quarter of the data is above the 75th percentile, leaving the “middle half” of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half. 4.2.3 Mean absolute deviation The two measures we’ve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at quantiles. However, this isn’t the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select some meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the “typical” deviations from that. What do we mean by “typical” deviation? Usually, the mean or median value of these deviations. In practice, this leads to two different measures, the “mean absolute deviation” (from the mean) and the “median absolute deviation” (from the median). The measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics and might be the better of the two, but it’s less frequently used in psychology, per Danielle’s observation. The measure based on the mean occasionally shows up in psychology; hence we will cover this measure in this chapter. One useful thing about mean absolute deviation is that the name tells you exactly how to calculate it. Let’s think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again we’ll start by pretending that there’s only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case, the mean), the first thing we need to look up is the mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\). For these five observations, our mean is \\(\\bar{X} = 36.6\\). The next step is to convert each of our observations \\(X_i\\) into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). That is, the deviation score is defined to be \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\). For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to \\(56 - 36.6 = 19.4\\). The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of \\(-3\\) as \\(|-3|\\), and so we say that \\(|-3| = 3\\). We use the absolute value function here because we don’t care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean; we’re just interested in how close it is to the mean. To help make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these calculations for all five observations: the observation its symbol the observed value winning margin, game 1 \\(X_1\\) 56 points winning margin, game 2 \\(X_2\\) 31 points winning margin, game 3 \\(X_3\\) 56 points winning margin, game 4 \\(X_4\\) 8 points winning margin, game 5 \\(X_5\\) 32 points Now that we have calculated the absolute deviation score for every observation in the data set, we only have to calculate the mean of these scores. Let’s do that: \\[ \\frac{19.4 + 5.6 + 19.4 + 28.6 + 4.6}{5} = 15.52 \\] And we’re done. The mean absolute deviation for these five scores is 15.52. However, while our calculations for this little example are at an end, we do have a couple of things left to talk about. Firstly, we should really try to write down a proper mathematical formula. But in order to do this, we need some mathematical notation to refer to the mean absolute deviation. Irritatingly, “mean absolute deviation” and “median absolute deviation” have the same acronym (MAD), which leads to a certain amount of ambiguity. What we’ll do is use AAD instead, short for average absolute deviation. Now that we have some unambiguous notation, here’s the formula that describes what we just calculated: \\[ \\mbox{}(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}| \\] The last thing we must discuss is how to calculate AAD in CogStat. Currently, the software does not automatically compute this, and no manual interventions exist. This calculation might get added in a future release if needed, but if you bear with us for two more chapters, you’ll see a more useful measure instead. 4.2.4 Variance Although the mean absolute deviation measure has its uses, it’s not the best measure of variability. From a purely mathematical perspective, there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations over absolute deviations. With square deviations, we obtain a measure called variance. The variance of a data set \\(X\\) is sometimes written as \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\), but it’s more commonly denoted \\(s^2\\). The reason for this will become clearer shortly. The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows: \\[ \\mbox{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] \\[\\mbox{Var}(X) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2}{N}\\] As you can see, it’s basically the same formula that we used to calculate the mean absolute deviation, except that instead of using “absolute deviations”, we use “squared deviations”. For this reason, the variance is sometimes referred to as the “mean square deviation”. Variances are additive. Here’s what that means: suppose we have two variables (\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)), whose variances are \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\) and \\(\\mbox{Var}(Y)\\) respectively. Now imagine we want to define a new variable \\(Z\\) that is the sum of the two, \\(Z = X+Y\\). As it turns out, the variance of \\(Z\\) is equal to \\(\\mbox{Var}(X) + \\mbox{Var}(Y)\\). This is a very useful property, but it’s not true of the other measures. Now that we’ve got the basic idea let’s look at a concrete example. Once again, let’s use the first five AFL games as our data. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table: \\(i\\) [which game] \\(X_i\\) [value] \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) [deviation from mean] \\((X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) [absolute squared deviation] 1 56 19.4 376.36 2 31 -5.6 31.36 3 56 19.4 376.36 4 8 -28.6 817.96 5 32 -4.6 21.16 That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to do is average them. \\[ \\frac{( 376.36 + 31.36 + 376.36 + 817.96 + 21.16 )}{5} = 324.64 \\] Exciting, isn’t it? Now, let’s tackle the burning question you’re probably thinking: What does a variance of 324.64 mean? How do you interpret the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now, the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why we haven’t given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn’t one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it’s utterly useless if you want to communicate with an actual human. Variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable. All the numbers have been squared, and they don’t mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. CogStat will not attempt to interpret the variance nor will it give you the raw value. But the next chapter will show you another measure instead: the standard deviation. 4.2.5 Standard deviation Suppose you would like to have a measure expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e. points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the standard deviation, also called the “root mean squared deviation”, or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly: while nobody has a clue what “a variance of 324.68 points-squared” really means, it’s much easier to understand “a standard deviation of 18.01 points” since it’s expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as \\(s\\), though “SD” and “Std dev.” are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won’t be surprised to see that the formula is: \\[ s = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn’t have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us rely on a simple rule of thumb: in general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation (1 sigma) of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviation (2 sigmas) of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations (3 sigmas) of the mean. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but it’s not exact: it’s actually calculated based on an assumption that the histogram is symmetric and “bell shaped”, i.e. the data are normally distributed, which is an important concept that we’ll discuss more in Chapter 6. So how do we interpret standard deviation? Basically, if the standard deviation is small (relatively closer to zero), then the data are clustered close to the mean. Conversely, if the standard deviation is large (relatively closer to the interquartile range), then the data are more spread out. As you can tell from the AFL winning margins histogram in Figure 4.4, this isn’t exactly true of our data! Even so, the rule is approximately correct. As it turns out, 65.3% of the AFL margins data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. 4.2.6 Median absolute deviation The last measure of variability to talk about is the median absolute deviation (MAD). The basic idea behind MAD is identical to the one behind the mean absolute deviation (Section 4.2.3). The difference is that you use the median everywhere. This has a straightforward interpretation: every observation in the data set lies some distance away from the typical value (the median). So the MAD is an attempt to describe a typical deviation from a typical value in the data set. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to interpret the MAD value of \\(19.5\\) for our AFL data by saying something like this: The median winning margin in 2010 was 30.5, indicating that a typical game involved a winning margin of about 30 points. However, there was a fair amount of variation from game to game: the MAD value was 19.5, indicating that a typical winning margin would differ from this median value by about 19-20 points. In the same way that the mean is very sensitive to extreme values, so is the standard deviation. So, in much the same way that people sometimes use the median as a “robust” way of calculating “something that is like the mean”, it’s not uncommon to use MAD as a method for calculating “something that is like the standard deviation”. Unfortunately, the raw MAD value doesn’t do this. Our raw MAD value is 19.5, and our standard deviation was 26.07. Under the assumption again that the data are normally distributed, you can multiply the raw MAD value by 1.4826 and obtain a number that is directly comparable to the standard deviation. That’s really not true for our afl.margins data, so in this case I wouldn’t try to use the MAD value this way. As standard deviation is used almost all of the time in psychology research, CogStat will not be calculating MAD for you. 4.2.7 Which measure to use? We’ve discussed quite a few measures of spread (range, IQR, MAD, variance and standard deviation) and hinted at their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a quick summary: Range. Gives you the full spread of the data. It’s very vulnerable to outliers, and as a consequence, it isn’t often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data. Interquartile range. Tells you where the “middle half” of the data sits. It’s pretty robust and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot. Mean absolute deviation. Tells you how far “on average” the observations are from the mean. It’s very interpretable but has a few minor issues that make it less attractive to statisticians than the standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often. Variance. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It’s mathematically elegant and is probably the “right” way to describe variation around the mean, but it’s completely uninterpretable because it doesn’t use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool, but it’s buried “under the hood” of a very large number of statistical tools. Standard deviation. This is the square root of the variance. It’s fairly elegant mathematically, and it’s expressed in the same units as the data, so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation. Median absolute deviation. The typical (i.e., median) deviation from the median value. In the raw form, it’s simple and interpretable; in the corrected form, it’s a robust way to estimate the standard deviation for some kinds of data sets. Not used very often, but it does get reported sometimes. In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common measures used to report the variability of the data. Still, there are situations in which range or other measures are used. 4.3 Skewness and kurtosis There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see reported in the psychological literature, known as skewness and kurtosis. In practice, neither is used nearly as frequently as the central tendency and variability measures we’ve discussed. Skewness is critical, so you see it mentioned a fair bit. Figure 4.7: An illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set (skewness \\(= -.93\\)), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (technically, skewness \\(= -.006\\)), and on the right we have a positively skewed data set (skewness \\(= .93\\)). Since it’s the more interesting of the two, let’s start by talking about the skewness. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry, and the easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As Figure 4.7 illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel), then we say that the data are negatively skewed. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are positively skewed. That’s the qualitative idea behind skewness. The actual formula for the skewness of a data set is as follows \\[ \\mbox{skewness}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat{\\sigma}^3} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^3 \\] where \\(N\\) is the number of observations, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) is the standard deviation (the “divide by \\(N-1\\)” version, that is). Not surprisingly, it turns out that the AFL winning margins data is fairly skewed: \\(0.8\\). Put simply, kurtosis is a measure of the “pointiness” of a data set, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. Figure 4.8: An illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a “platykurtic” data set (kurtosis = \\(-.95\\)), meaning that the data set is “too flat”. In the middle we have a “mesokurtic” data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0), which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a “leptokurtic” data set (kurtosis \\(= 2.12\\)) indicating that the data set is “too pointy”. Note that kurtosis is measured with respect to a normal curve (black line) By convention, we say that the “normal curve” (black lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this curve. In this Figure, the data on the left is not pointy enough, so the kurtosis is negative, and we call the data platykurtic. The data on the right are too pointy, so the kurtosis is positive and we say that the data is leptokurtic. But the data in the middle are just pointy enough, so we say that it is mesokurtic and has kurtosis zero. This is summarised in the table below: informal term technical name kurtosis value too flat platykurtic negative just pointy enough mesokurtic zero too pointy leptokurtic positive The equation for kurtosis is similar in spirit to the formulas we’ve seen already for the variance and the skewness. Except that where the variance involved squared deviations and the skewness involved cubed deviations, the kurtosis involves raising the deviations to the fourth power:15 \\[ \\mbox{kurtosis}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat\\sigma^4} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^4 - 3 \\] When reading the automatically calculated kurtosis value from our CogStat result set, we discover that the AFL winning margins data is just pointy enough: \\(0.1\\). 4.4 Summary: descriptives We have covered some key aspects of how to summarise what we have learned about the data. As a summary, the following table lists the measures that CogStat will calculate for you, with a brief explanation of what they are and how they are used. Table 4.1: Descriptives for the variable afl.margins Meaning Mean 35.3 Average – the “centre of gravity” of the data Standard deviation 26.0 How clustered is the data around the mean (smaller figure means more clustered, larger figure closer to interquartile range means more spread out) Skewness 0.8 The assymetry of the data compared to a normal distribution (bell curve) Kurtosis 0.1 Pointiness of the data. Smaller figure means more pointy, larger figure means less pointy Range 116.0 The spread of the data set between the maximum and minimum values Maximum 116.0 The highest value in the data set Upper quartile 50.5 25% of the data points reside at and above this value Median 30.5 This is the value of the data point in the middle (or the average of the two middle points in case of even number of data points). 50-50% of data points reside at above and below this value Lower quartile 12.8 25% of the data points reside at and below this value Minimum 0.0 The lowest value in the data set Note for non-Australians: the AFL is an Australian rules football competition.

What we have not done is talk about how to describe the relationships between variables in the data. To do that, we want to talk mainly about the correlation between variables. But first, we need some data. After watching the AFL data, let’s turn to a topic close to every parent’s heart: sleep. The following data set is fictitious but based on real events. Suppose we’re curious to determine how much a baby’s sleeping habits affect the parent’s mood. Let’s say we can rate parent grumpiness very precisely on a scale from 0 (not at all grumpy) to 100 (very, very grumpy). And let’s also assume that we’ve been measuring parent grumpiness, parent sleeping patterns, and the baby’s sleeping patterns for 100 days. Figure 5.1: This is what you would see after loading the parenthood.csv dataset. As described in Chapter 4, we can get all the necessary descriptive statistics for all the variables: parentsleep, babysleep and grumpiness. Let’s summarise all these into a neat little table. Table 5.1: Descriptive statistics for the parenthood data. Parent grumpiness Parent’s hours slept Baby’s hours slept parentgrump parentsleep babysleep Mean 63.7 6.965 8.049 Standard deviation 10 1.011 2.064 Skewness 0.4 -0.296 -0.024 Kurtosis 0 -0.649 -0.613 Range 50 4.16 8.82 Maximum 91 9 12.07 Upper quartile 71 7.74 9.635 Median 62 7.03 7.95 Lower quartile 57 6.292 6.425 Minimum 41 4.84 3.25 To start understanding the relationship between a pair of variables, select Explore relation of variable pair so a pop-up appears.

Ideally, though, we might want to say a bit more about it than that. For instance, let’s compare the relationship between parentsleep and parentgrump (Figure 5.2 with that between babysleep and parentgrump (Figure 5.3. When looking at these two plots side by side, it’s clear that the relationship is qualitatively the same in both cases: more sleep equals less grump! However, it’s also obvious that the relationship between parentsleep and parentgrump is stronger than between babysleep and parentgrump. The plot on the left is “neater” than on the right. It feels like if you want to predict the parent’s mood, it will help you a little bit to know how many hours the baby slept, but it’d be more helpful to know how many hours the parent slept. In contrast, let’s consider Figure 5.3 vs. Figure 5.4. If we compare the scatterplot of “babysleep v parentgrump” to the scatterplot of “`babysleep v parentsleep”, the overall strength of the relationship is the same, but the direction is different. If the baby sleeps more, the parent gets more sleep (positive relationship, but if the baby sleeps more, then the parent gets less grumpy (negative relationship). Figure 5.4: Scatterplot drawn by CogStat showing the relationship between babysleep and parentsleep 5.2 The correlation coefficient We can make these ideas a bit more explicit by introducing the idea of a correlation coefficient (or, more specifically, Pearson’s correlation coefficient), which is traditionally denoted by \\(r\\). The correlation coefficient between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (sometimes denoted \\(r_{XY}\\)), which we’ll define more precisely in the next section, is a measure that varies from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). When \\(r = -1\\), it means that we have a perfect negative relationship, and when \\(r = 1\\), it means we have a perfect positive relationship. When \\(r = 0\\), there’s no relationship at all. If you look at Figure 5.5, you can see several plots showing what different correlations visually look like. Figure 5.5: Illustration of the effect of varying the strength and direction of a correlation The Pearson’s correlation coefficient formula can be written in several ways. The simplest way to write down the formula is to break it into two steps. Firstly, let’s introduce the idea of a covariance. The covariance between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a generalisation of the notion of the variance. It is a mathematically simple way of describing the relationship between two variables that isn’t terribly informative to humans: \\[ \\mbox{Cov}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right) \\left( Y_i - \\bar{Y} \\right) \\] Because we’re multiplying (i.e., taking the “product” of) a quantity that depends on \\(X\\) by a quantity that depends on \\(Y\\) and then averaging16, you can think of the formula for the covariance as an “average cross product” between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The covariance has the nice property that, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are entirely unrelated, the covariance is exactly zero. If the relationship between them is positive (in the sense shown in Figure 5.5), then the covariance is also positive. If the relationship is negative, then the covariance is also negative. In other words, the covariance captures the basic qualitative idea of correlation. Unfortunately, the raw magnitude of the covariance isn’t easy to interpret: it depends on the units in which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are expressed, and worse yet, the actual units in which the covariance is expressed are really weird. For instance, if \\(X\\) refers to the parentsleep variable (units: hours) and \\(Y\\) refers to the parentgrump variable (units: grumps), then the units for their covariance are “hours \\(\\times\\) grumps”. And I have no freaking idea what that would even mean. The Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r\\) fixes this interpretation problem by standardising the covariance in the same way that the \\(z\\)-score standardises a raw score: dividing by the standard deviation. However, because we have two variables that contribute to the covariance, the standardisation only works if we divide by both standard deviations.17 In other words, the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can be written as follows: \\[ r_{XY} = \\frac{\\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)}{ \\hat{\\sigma}_X \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_Y} \\] By doing this standardisation, we keep all of the nice properties of the covariance discussed earlier, and the actual values of \\(r\\) are on a meaningful scale: \\(r= 1\\) implies a perfect positive relationship, and \\(r = -1\\) implies a perfect negative relationship. 5.3 Interpreting a correlation Naturally, in real life, you don’t see many correlations of 1. So how should you interpret a correlation of, say \\(r= .4\\)? The honest answer is that it really depends on what you want to use the data for, and on how strong the correlations in your field tend to be. A friend of Danielle’s in engineering once argued that any correlation less than \\(.95\\) is completely useless (he may have been exaggerating, even for engineering). On the other hand, there are real cases – even in psychology – where you should expect strong correlations. For instance, one of the benchmark data sets used to test theories of how people judge similarities is so clean that any theory that can’t achieve a correlation of at least \\(.9\\) isn’t deemed successful. However, when looking for (say) elementary intelligence correlates (e.g., inspection time, response time), if you get a correlation above \\(.3\\) you’re doing very well. In short, the interpretation of a correlation depends a lot on the context. That said, the rough guide in Table 5.2 is fairly typical. Table 5.2: Rough guide to interpreting correlations Correlation Strength Direction -1.0 to -0.9 Very strong Negative -0.9 to -0.7 Strong Negative -0.7 to -0.4 Moderate Negative -0.4 to -0.2 Weak Negative -0.2 to 0 Negligible Negative 0 to 0.2 Negligible Positive 0.2 to 0.4 Weak Positive 0.4 to 0.7 Moderate Positive 0.7 to 0.9 Strong Positive 0.9 to 1.0 Very strong Positive However, something that can never be stressed enough is that you should always look at the scatterplot before attaching any interpretation to the data. A correlation might not mean what you think it means. The classic illustration of this is “Anscombe’s Quartet” (Anscombe, 1973), which is a collection of four data sets. Each data set has two variables, an \\(X\\) and a \\(Y\\). For all four data sets, the mean value for \\(X\\) is 9, and the mean for \\(Y\\) is 7.5. The standard deviations for all \\(X\\) variables are almost identical, as are the standard deviations for the \\(Y\\) variables. And in each case the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\(r = 0.816\\). You’d think that these four data sets would look pretty similar to one another. They do not. If we draw scatterplots of \\(X\\) against \\(Y\\) for all four variables, as shown in Figure 5.6 we see that all four of these are spectacularly different to each other. Figure 5.6: Anscombe’s quartet. All four of these data sets have a Pearson correlation of \\(r = .816\\), but they are qualitatively different from one another. The lesson here, which so very many people seem to forget in real life, is “always graph your raw data”. 5.4 Spearman’s rank correlations Figure 5.7: The relationship between hours worked and grade received for a toy data set consisting of only 10 students (each circle corresponds to one student). The dashed line through the middle shows the linear relationship between the two variables. This produces a strong Pearson correlation of \\(r = .91\\). However, the interesting thing to note here is that there’s actually a perfect monotonic relationship between the two variables: in this toy example, at least, increasing the hours worked always increases the grade received, as illustrated by the solid line. This is reflected in a Spearman correlation of \\(rho = 1\\). With such a small data set, however, it’s an open question as to which version better describes the actual relationship involved. The Pearson correlation coefficient is useful for many things, but it has shortcomings. One particular issue stands out: what it actually measures is the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. In other words, it gives you a measure of the extent to which the data all tend to fall on a single, perfectly straight line. Often, this is a pretty good approximation to what we mean when we say “relationship”, and so the Pearson correlation is a good thing to calculate. Sometimes, it isn’t. One very common situation where the Pearson correlation isn’t quite the right thing to use arises when an increase in one variable \\(X\\) really is reflected in an increase in another variable \\(Y\\). However, the nature of the relationship isn’t necessarily linear. An example of this might be the relationship between effort and reward when studying for an exam. If you put zero effort (\\(X\\)) into learning a subject, you should expect a grade of 0% (\\(Y\\)). However, a little bit of effort will cause a massive improvement: just turning up to lectures means that you learn a fair bit and if you just turn up to classes and scribble a few things down so your grade might rise to 35%, all without a lot of effort. However, you just don’t get the same effect at the other end of the scale. As everyone knows, it takes a lot more effort to get a grade of 90% than it takes to get a grade of 55%. This means that if I’ve got data looking at study effort and grades, there’s a good chance that Pearson correlations will be misleading. To illustrate, consider the data plotted in Figure 5.7, showing the relationship between hours worked and grade received for 10 students taking some classes. The curious thing about this – highly fictitious – data set is that increasing your effort always increases your grade. It might be by a lot or by a little, but increasing the effort will never decrease your grade. The data are stored in effort.csv. CogStat will calculate a standard Pearson correlation first[^Unless, of course, you set your measurement level in the second row of the CSV as \"ord\" (ordinal), because then you already tell the software that Pearson’s \\(r\\) does not make sense to look at.]. It shows a strong relationship between hours worked and grade received: \\(r = 0.909\\). But this doesn’t actually capture the observation that increasing hours worked always increases the grade. There’s a sense here in which we want to say that the correlation is perfect but for a somewhat different notion of a “relationship”. What we’re looking for is something that captures the fact that there is a perfect ordinal relationship here. That is, if student 1 works more hours than student 2, then we can guarantee that student 1 will get a better grade. That’s not what a correlation of \\(r = 0.91\\) says at all. How should we address this? Actually, it’s really easy: if we’re looking for ordinal relationships, all we have to do is treat the data as if it were an ordinal scale! So, instead of measuring effort in terms of “hours worked”, let us rank all 10 of our students in order of hours worked. That is, student 1 did the least work out of anyone (2 hours), so they got the lowest rank (rank = 1). Student 4 was the next laziest, putting in only 6 hours of work over the whole semester, so they got the next lowest rank (rank = 2). Notice that we’re using “rank = 1” to mean “low rank”. Sometimes in everyday language, we talk about “rank = 1” to mean “top rank” rather than “bottom rank”. So be careful: you can rank “from smallest value to largest value” (i.e., small equals rank 1), or you can rank “from largest value to smallest value” (i.e., large equals rank 1). In this case, we’re ranking from smallest to largest. But in real life, it’s really easy to forget which way you set things up, so you have to put a bit of effort into remembering! Okay, so let’s have a look at our students when we rank them from worst to best in terms of effort and reward: Student Rank (hours worked) Rank (grade received) student 1 1 1 student 2 10 10 student 3 6 6 student 4 2 2 student 5 3 3 student 6 5 5 student 7 4 4 student 8 8 8 student 9 7 7 student 10 9 9 Hm. These are identical. The student who put in the most effort got the best grade, the student with the least effort got the worst grade, etc. We can rank students by hours worked, then rank students by grade received, and these two rankings would be identical. So if we now correlate them, we get a perfect relationship: \\(1\\). We’ve just re-invented the Spearman’s rank order correlation, usually denoted \\(\\rho\\) (pronounced: rho) to distinguish it from the Pearson correlation \\(r\\). CogStat will use \\(r_{S}\\) to denote rank order correlation. CogStat will automatically calculate both Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank order correlation for you if your measurement is not set in your source data (Figure 5.8). If you set the measurement type to “ordinal” in your source file, it will omit to calculate Pearson’s correlation due to the above reasons. Figure 5.8: This is what you would see in CogStat after loading the effort.csv dataset. 5.5 Missing values in pairwise calculations To illustrate the issues, let’s open up a data set with missing values, parenthood_missing.csv. This file contains the same data as the original parenthood data but with some values deleted. While the original source could contain an empty value or NA, CogStat will display NaN for these missing values (Figure 5.9). Figure 5.9: This is what you would see in CogStat after loading the parenthood_missing.csv dataset. Let’s calculate descriptive statistics using the Explore variable function (See Chapter: 4): Table 5.3: Descriptive statistics for the parenthood data with missing values. We can observe the slight difference in our statistics when we have missing values. Parent grumpiness Parent’s hours slept Baby’s hours slept parentgrump parentsleep babysleep Mean 63.2 6.977 8.114 Standard deviation 9.8 1.015 2.035 Skewness 0.4 -0.346 -0.096 Kurtosis -0.2 -0.647 -0.5 Range 48 4.16 8.82 Maximum 89 9 12.07 Upper quartile 70.2 7.785 9.61 Median 61 7.03 8.2 Lower quartile 56 6.285 6.46 Minimum 41 4.84 3.25 We can see that there are 9 missing values for parentsleep (N of missing cases: 9), 11 missing values for babysleep (N of missing cases: 11), and 8 missing values for parentgrump (N of missing cases: 8). Whichever comparison you’d like to run (e.g., parentsleep vs. parentgrump), CogStat will automatically exclude the missing values from the calculation: Figure 5.10: 17 missing pairs when comparing parentsleep and parentgrump Figure 5.11: 18 missing pairs when comparing babysleep and parentgrump Figure 5.12: 20 missing pairs when comparing babysleep and parentsleep 5.6 Summary In this chapter, we discussed how to measure the relationship between two variables. We introduced the concept of correlation and how to calculate it using CogStat. We also discussed the difference between Pearson’s correlation (Chapter 5.2) and Spearman’s rank order correlation (Chapter 5.4), and how CogStat will calculate it for you. Finally, we discussed how CogStat handles missing values (Chapter 5.5) in pairwise calculations. Just like we saw with the variance and the standard deviation, in practice, we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\).↩︎ This is an oversimplification.↩︎ "],["probability.html", "Chapter 6 Probability and distributions 6.1 How are probability and statistics different? 6.2 What does probability mean? 6.3 Basic probability theory 6.4 Distributions 6.5 Summary", " Chapter 6 Probability and distributions Up to this point in the book, we’ve discussed some critical ideas in experimental design and talked a little about how you can summarise a data set. To many people, this is all there is to statistics: it’s about calculating averages, collecting all the numbers, drawing pictures, and putting them all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp collecting, but with numbers. However, statistics cover much more than that. Descriptive statistics is one of the less significant parts of statistics and one of the least powerful. The more valuable part of statistics is that it provides tools that let you make inferences about data. Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms – that statistics are there to help us draw inferences from data – you start seeing examples everywhere. For instance, here’s a small extract from a newspaper article in the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010): “I have a tough job,” the Premier said in response to a poll which found her government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent. This kind of remark is unremarkable in the papers or in everyday life, but let’s consider what it entails. A polling company has conducted an extensive survey because they can afford it. Let’s imagine that they called 1000 NSW voters at random, and 230 (23%) of those claimed that they intended to vote for the ALP. For the 2010 Federal election, the Australian Electoral Commission reported 4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of the remaining 4,609,795 voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown to us. Even assuming that no one lied to the polling company, we can only say with 100% confidence that the actual ALP primary vote is somewhere between 230/4610795 (about 0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 (about 99.83%). So, on what basis is it legitimate for the polling company, the newspaper, and the readership to conclude that the ALP primary vote is only about 23%? The answer to the question is pretty obvious: if we call 1000 people at random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it seems very unlikely that these are the only 230 people out of the entire voting public who actually intend to do so. In other words, we assume that the data collected by the polling company is pretty representative of the population at large. But how representative? Would we be surprised to discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually 24%? 29%? 37%? At this point, everyday intuition starts to break down a bit. No one would be surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised by 37%, but it’s hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need more powerful tools than just looking at the numbers and guessing. Inferential statistics provides the tools we need to answer these questions. Since these questions lie at the heart of the scientific enterprise, they take up the lion’s share of every introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the theory of statistical inference is built on top of probability theory. And it is to probability theory that we must now turn. This discussion of probability theory is basically background: there’s not a lot of statistics per se in this chapter, and you don’t need to understand this material in as much depth as in the other chapters in this part of the book. Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin so much of statistics, it’s worth covering some of the basics. 6.1 How are probability and statistics different? Before discussing probability theory, it’s helpful to consider the relationship between probability and statistics. The two disciplines are closely related, but they’re not identical. Probability theory is “the doctrine of chances”. It’s a branch of mathematics that tells you how often different events will happen. For example, all of these questions are things you can answer using probability theory: What are the chances of a fair coin coming up heads 10 times in a row? If we roll two six-sided dice, how likely is it that we’ll roll two sixes? How likely is it that five cards drawn from a perfectly shuffled deck will all be hearts? What are the chances that we’ll win the lottery? Notice that all of these questions have something in common. In each case the “truth of the world” is known, and my question relates to the “what kind of events” will happen. In the first question, we know that the coin is fair, so there’s a 50% chance that any individual coin flip will come up heads. In the second question, we know that the chance of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1 in 6. In the third question, we know that the deck is shuffled properly. And in the fourth question, we know that the lottery follows specific rules. You get the idea. The critical point is that probabilistic questions start with a known model of the world, and we use that model to do some calculations. The underlying model can be quite simple. For instance, in the coin flipping example, we can write down the model like this: \\[ P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5 \\] which you can read as “the probability of heads is 0.5”. As we’ll see later, in the same way, percentages are numbers that range from 0% to 100%, and probabilities are just numbers that range from 0 to 1. When using this probability model to answer the first question, we don’t know exactly what will happen. Maybe we’ll get 10 heads like the question says. But perhaps we’ll get three heads. That’s the key thing: in probability theory, the model is known, but the data are not. So that’s probability. What about statistics? Statistical questions work the other way around. In statistics, we do not know the truth about the world. All we have is the data from which we want to learn the truth about the world. Statistical questions tend to look more like these: If a friend flips a coin 10 times and gets 10 heads, are they playing a trick? If five cards off the top of the deck are all hearts, how likely is it that the deck was shuffled? If the lottery commissioner’s spouse wins the lottery, how likely is it that the lottery was rigged? This time around, the only thing we have are data. What we know is that we saw a friend flip the coin 10 times, and it came up heads every time. And what we want to infer is whether or not we should conclude that what we just saw was actually a fair coin being flipped 10 times in a row, or whether we should suspect that the friend is playing a trick on us. The data we have look like this: H H H H H H H H H H H and what we’re trying to do is work out which “model of the world” we should put my trust in. If the coin is fair, then the model we should adopt is one that says that the probability of heads is 0.5; that is, \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5\\). If the coin is not fair, then we should conclude that the probability of heads is not 0.5, which we would write as \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) \\neq 0.5\\). In other words, the statistical inference problem is to figure out which of these probability models is right. Clearly, the statistical question isn’t the same as the probability question, but they’re deeply connected to one another. Because of this, a good introduction to statistical theory will start with a discussion of what probability is and how it works. 6.2 What does probability mean? Let’s start with the first of these questions. What is “probability”? It might seem surprising to you, but while statisticians and mathematicians (mostly) agree on what the rules of probability are, there’s much less of a consensus on what the word really means. It seems weird because we’re all very comfortable using words like “chance”, “likely”, “possible”, and “probable”, and it doesn’t seem like it should be a complicated question to answer. If you had to explain “probability” to a five-year-old, you could do a pretty good job. But if you’ve ever had that experience in real life, you might walk away from the conversation feeling like you didn’t quite get it right and that (like many everyday concepts) it turns out that you don’t really know what it’s all about. Let’s suppose we want to bet on a soccer game between two teams of robots, Arduino Arsenal and C Milan. After thinking about it, we decide that there is an 80% probability that Arduino Arsenal winning. What do we mean by that? Here are three possibilities: They’re robot teams, so we can make them play over and over again, and if we did that, Arduino Arsenal would win 8 out of every 10 games on average. For any given game, we would only agree that betting on this game is only “fair” if a $1 bet on C Milan gives a $5 payoff (i.e. we get $1 back plus a $4 reward for being correct), as would a $4 bet on Arduino Arsenal (i.e., $4 bet plus a $1 reward). Our subjective “belief” or “confidence” in an Arduino Arsenal victory is four times as strong as our belief in a C Milan victory. Each of these seems sensible. However, they’re not identical, and not every statistician would endorse all of them. The reason is that there are different statistical ideologies (yes, really!) and depending on which one you subscribe to, you might say that some of those statements are meaningless or irrelevant. In this section, we give a brief introduction to the two main approaches that exist in the literature. These are by no means the only approaches, but they’re the two big ones. 6.2.1 The frequentist view The first of the two major approaches to probability, and the more dominant one in statistics, is referred to as the frequentist view, which defines probability as a long-run frequency. Suppose we were to try flipping a fair coin over and over again. By definition, this is a coin that has \\(P(H) = 0.5\\). What might we observe? One possibility is that the first 20 flips might look like this: T,H,H,H,H,T,T,H,H,H,H,T,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,H In this case, 11 of these 20 coin flips (55%) came up heads. Now suppose that we’d been keeping a running tally of the number of heads (which we’ll call \\(N_H\\)) that we’ve seen, across the first \\(N\\) flips, and calculate the proportion of heads \\(N_H / N\\) every time. Here’s what we’d get: Number of flips Number of heads Proportion of heads 1 0 0.00 2 1 0.50 3 2 0.67 4 3 0.75 5 4 0.80 6 4 0.67 7 4 0.57 8 5 0.63 9 6 0.67 10 7 0.70 11 8 0.73 12 8 0.67 13 9 0.69 14 10 0.71 15 10 0.67 16 10 0.63 17 10 0.59 18 10 0.56 19 10 0.53 20 11 0.55 Notice that at the start of the sequence, the proportion of heads fluctuates wildly, starting at .00 and rising as high as .80. Later on, one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of the values actually being pretty close to the “right” answer of .50. This is the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell: flip a fair coin over and over again, and as \\(N\\) grows large (approaches infinity, denoted \\(N\\rightarrow \\infty\\)), the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. There are some subtle technicalities that mathematicians care about, but qualitatively speaking, that’s how the frequentists define probability. Unfortunately, we don’t have an infinite number of coins, or the infinite patience required to flip a coin an infinite number of times. However, we do have a computer, and computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. So let’s ask a computer to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times, and then draw a picture of what happens to the proportion \\(N_H / N\\) as \\(N\\) increases. The results are shown in Figure 6.1. As you can see, the proportion of observed heads eventually stops fluctuating, and settles down; when it does, the number at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads. Figure 6.1: An illustration of how frequentist probability works. If you flip a fair coin over and over again, the proportion of heads that you’ve seen eventually settles down, and converges to the true probability of 0.5. Each panel shows four different simulated experiments: in each case, we pretend we flipped a coin 1000 times, and kept track of the proportion of flips that were heads as we went along. Although none of these sequences actually ended up with an exact value of .5, if we’d extended the experiment for an infinite number of coin flips they would have. The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable characteristics. Firstly, it is objective: the probability of an event is necessarily grounded in the world. The only way that probability statements can make sense is if they refer to (a sequence of) events that occur in the physical universe.18 Secondly, it is unambiguous: any two people watching the same sequence of events unfold, trying to calculate the probability of an event, must inevitably come up with the same answer. However, it also has undesirable characteristics. Firstly, infinite sequences don’t exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin from your pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands, it impacts the ground. Each impact wears the coin down a bit; eventually, the coin will be destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to pretend that an “infinite” sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful concept or an objective one. We can’t say that an “infinite sequence” of events is a real thing in the physical universe because the physical universe doesn’t allow infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist definition has a narrow scope. There are many things out there that human beings are happy to assign a probability to in everyday language but cannot (even in theory) be mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of events. For instance, if a meteorologist comes on TV and says, “the probability of rain in Adelaide on 2 November 2048 is 60%”, we humans are happy to accept this. But it’s not clear how to define this in frequentist terms. There’s only one city of Adelaide, and only 2 November 2048. There’s no infinite sequence of events here, just a once-off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely forbids us from making probability statements about a single event. From the frequentist perspective, it will either rain tomorrow or not; there is no “probability” that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. Now, it should be said that there are some very clever tricks that frequentists can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the meteorologist means is something like this: “There is a category of days for which we predict a 60% chance of rain; if we look only across those days for which we make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will actually rain”. It’s very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this way, but you do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it will come up later in this book (see Section 7.5). 6.2.2 The Bayesian view The Bayesian view of probability is often called the subjectivist view, and it is a minority view among statisticians but one that has been steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are many flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say what “the” Bayesian view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective probability is to define the probability of an event as the degree of belief that an intelligent and rational agent assigns to the truth of that event. From that perspective, probabilities don’t exist in the world but rather in the thoughts and assumptions of people and other intelligent beings. However, for this approach to work, we need some way of operationalising the “degree of belief”. One way you can do this is to formalise it in terms of “rational gambling”, though there are many other ways. Suppose that we believe that there’s a 60% probability of rain tomorrow. If someone offers us a bet: if it rains tomorrow, then we win $5, but if it doesn’t rain, then we lose $5. Clearly, from our perspective, this is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if we think the probability of rain is only 40%, then it’s a bad bet. Thus, we can operationalise the notion of a “subjective probability” in terms of what bets we’re willing to accept. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian approach? The main advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event you want to. You don’t need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can’t be purely objective – specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity with the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician, but there has to be an intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people, this is uncomfortable: it seems to make probability arbitrary. While the Bayesian approach does require that the agent in question be rational (i.e., obey the rules of probability), it does allow everyone to have their own beliefs; I can believe the coin is fair, and you don’t have to, even though we’re both rational. The frequentist view doesn’t allow any two observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event: when that happens, then at least one of them must be wrong. The Bayesian view does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with different background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about the same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes considered to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to assign probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too broad (allows too many differences between observers). 6.2.3 What’s the difference? And who is right? Now that you’ve seen these two views independently, it’s useful to make sure you can compare them. Go back to the hypothetical robot soccer game at the start of the section. What would a frequentist and a Bayesian say about these three statements? Which statement would a frequentist say is the correct definition of probability? Which one would a Bayesian do? Would some of these statements be meaningless to a frequentist or a Bayesian? If you’ve understood the two perspectives, you should have some sense of how to answer those questions. Okay, assuming you understand the difference, you might be wondering which of them is right? Honestly, we don’t know that there is a right answer. As far as we can tell, there’s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way frequentists think about sequences of events, and there’s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way that Bayesians define the beliefs of a rational agent. In fact, when you dig down into the details, Bayesians and frequentists actually agree about a lot of things. Many frequentist methods lead to decisions that Bayesians agree a rational agent would make. Many Bayesian methods have very good frequentist properties. Consider Sir Ronald Fisher, one of the towering figures of 20th-century statistics and a vehement opponent of all things Bayesian, whose paper on the mathematical foundations of statistics referred to Bayesian probability as “an impenetrable jungle [that] arrests progress towards precision of statistical concepts” Fisher (1922). Or the psychologist Paul Meehl, who suggests that relying on frequentist methods could turn you into “a potent but sterile intellectual rake who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring” Meehl (1967). The history of statistics, as you might gather, is not devoid of entertainment. In any case, while Danielle personally prefers the Bayesian view, the majority of statistical analyses are based on the frequentist approach. My reasoning is pragmatic: the goal of this book is to cover roughly the same territory as a typical undergraduate stats class in psychology, and if you want to understand the statistical tools used by most psychologists, you’ll need a good grasp of frequentist methods. We promise you that this isn’t a wasted effort. Even if you end up wanting to switch to the Bayesian perspective, you really should read through at least one book on the “orthodox” frequentist view. Every now and then, we’ll add some commentary from a Bayesian point of view, and we’ll revisit the topic in more depth in Chapter 9. 6.3 Basic probability theory Although there are ideological arguments between Bayesians and frequentists, it turns out that people mostly agree on the rules that probabilities should obey. There are lots of different ways of arriving at these rules. The most commonly used approach is based on the work of Andrey Kolmogorov, one of the great Soviet mathematicians of the 20th century. Without going into a lot of detail, we’ll try to give you a sense of how it works. Let’s assume we own five pairs of pants: three pairs of jeans, the bottom half of a suit, and a pair of tracksuit pants. Let’s call them \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(X_3\\), \\(X_4\\) and \\(X_5\\). Now, on any given day, we pick out exactly one pair of pants. If we were to describe this situation using the language of probability theory, we would refer to each pair of pants (i.e., each \\(X\\)) as an elementary event. The key characteristic of elementary events is that every time we make an observation (e.g., every time we put on a pair of pants), then the outcome will be one and only one of these events. As said, we only wear exactly one pair of pants, so it satisfies this constraint. Similarly, the set of all possible events is called a sample space. Okay, now that we have a sample space (a wardrobe) built from lots of possible elementary events (pants), we want to assign a probability of one of these elementary events. For an event \\(X\\), the probability of that event \\(P(X)\\) is a number that lies between 0 and 1. The bigger the value of \\(P(X)\\), the more likely the event will occur. So, for example, if \\(P(X) = 0\\), it means the event \\(X\\) is impossible (i.e., we never wear those pants). On the other hand, if \\(P(X) = 1\\) it means that event \\(X\\) is certain to occur (i.e., we always wear those pants). For probability values in the middle, it means that we sometimes wear those pants. For instance, if \\(P(X) = 0.5\\), it means that we wear those pants half of the time. At this point, we’re almost done. The last thing we need to recognise is that “something always happens”. Every time we put on pants, we really do end up wearing pants (crazy, right?). What this somewhat trite statement means, in probabilistic terms, is that the probabilities of the elementary events need to add up to 1. This is known as the law of total probability. More importantly, if these requirements are satisfied, then we have a probability distribution. For example, this is an example of a probability distribution Blue jeans Grey jeans Black jeans Black suit Blue tracksuit Label \\(X_1\\) \\(X_2\\) \\(X_3\\) \\(X_4\\) \\(X_5\\) Probability \\(P(X_1) = .5\\) \\(P(X_2) = .3\\) \\(P(X_3) = .1\\) \\(P(X_4) = 0\\) \\(P(X_5) = .1\\) Each of the events has a probability that lies between 0 and 1, and if we add up the probability of all events, they sum to 1, as shown in Figure 6.2. And at this point, we’ve all achieved something. You’ve learned what probability distribution is. Figure 6.2: A visual depiction of the “pants” probability distribution. There are five “elementary events”, corresponding to the five pairs of pants. Each event has some probability of occurring: this probability is a number between 0 to 1. The sum of these probabilities is 1. The only other thing that needs pointing out is that probability theory allows you to talk about non-elementary events as well as elementary ones. The easiest way to illustrate the concept is with an example. In the pants example, it’s legitimate to refer to the probability that we wear jeans. In this scenario, the “We wear jeans” event is said to have happened as long as the elementary event that actually did occur is one of the appropriate ones; in this case “blue jeans”, “black jeans”, or “grey jeans”. In mathematical terms, we defined the “jeans” event \\(E\\) to correspond to the set of elementary events \\((X_1, X_2, X_3)\\). If any of these elementary events occurs, then \\(E\\) is also said to have occurred. Having decided to write down the definition of the \\(E\\) this way, it’s pretty straightforward to state what the probability \\(P(E)\\) is: we just add everything up. In this particular case \\[ P(E) = P(X_1) + P(X_2) + P(X_3) \\] and, since the probabilities of blue, grey and black jeans respectively are .5, .3 and .1, the probability that we wear jeans is equal to .9. At this point, you might be thinking that this is all terribly obvious and simple, and you’d be right. All we’ve done is wrap some basic mathematics around a few common sense intuitions. However, from these simple beginnings, it’s possible to construct some extremely powerful mathematical tools. Without going into the details in this book, we list – in Table 6.1 – some of the other rules that probabilities satisfy. These rules can be derived from the simple assumptions that we’ve outlined above. Table 6.1: Some basic rules that probabilities must satisfy. You don’t really need to know these rules in order to understand the analyses that we’ll talk about later in the book, but they are important if you want to understand probability theory a bit more deeply. English Notation NANA Formula Not \\(A\\) \\(P(\\neg A)\\) = \\(1-P(A)\\) \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) = \\(P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) = \\(P(A|B) P(B)\\) 6.4 Distributions As you might imagine, probability distributions vary enormously, and there’s an enormous range of distributions. However, they aren’t all equally important. In fact, the vast majority of the content in this book relies on one of five distributions: the binomial distribution, the normal distribution, the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) (“chi-square”) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. Given this, the next few sections will briefly introduce all five of these, paying special attention to the binomial and the normal. 6.4.1 The binomial distribution The theory of probability originated in an attempt to describe how games of chance work. Hence, it seems fitting that our discussion of the binomial distribution should involve a discussion of rolling dice and flipping coins. Let’s imagine a simple “experiment”: we’re holding 20 identical six-sided dice. There’s a picture of a skull on one face of each die; the other five faces are all blank. If we roll all 20 dice, what’s the probability of getting exactly 4 skulls? Assuming that the dice are fair, we know that the chance of any one die coming up skulls is 1 in 6; to say this another way, the skull probability for a single die is approximately \\(0.167\\). This is enough information to answer our question, so let’s have a look at how it’s done. As usual, we’ll want to introduce some names and some notation. We’ll let \\(N\\) denote the number of dice rolls in our experiment, which is often referred to as the size parameter of our binomial distribution. We’ll also use \\(\\theta\\) to refer to the probability that a single die comes up skulls, a quantity that is usually called the success probability of the binomial.19 Finally, we’ll use \\(X\\) to refer to the results of our experiment, namely the number of skulls we get when rolling the dice. Since the actual value of \\(X\\) is due to chance, we refer to it as a random variable. In any case, now that we have all this terminology and notation, we can use it to state the problem a little more precisely. The quantity that we want to calculate is the probability that \\(X = 4\\) given that we know that \\(\\theta = .167\\) and \\(N=20\\). The general “form” of the thing could be written as \\[ P(X \\ | \\ \\theta, N) \\] and we’re interested in the special case where \\(X=4\\), \\(\\theta = 0.167\\) and \\(N=20\\). There’s only one more piece of notation. If we want to say that \\(X\\) is generated randomly from a binomial distribution with parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(N\\), the notation is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(\\theta, N) \\] Yeah, yeah. I know what you’re thinking: notation, notation, notation. Really, who cares? Very few readers of this book are here for the notation, so we should probably move on and talk about how to use the binomial distribution. We’ve included the formula for the binomial distribution in Table 6.2, since some readers may want to play with it themselves, but since most people probably don’t care that much and because we don’t need the formula in this book, let’s not talk about it in any detail. Instead, let’s just see what the binomial distribution looks like. To that end, Figure 6.3 plots the binomial probabilities for all possible values of \\(X\\) for our dice rolling experiment, from \\(X=0\\) (no skulls) all the way up to \\(X=20\\) (all skulls). Note that this is basically a bar chart, and is no different to the “pants probability” plot in Figure 6.2. On the horizontal axis we have all the possible events, and on the vertical axis we can read off the probability of each of those events. So, the probability of rolling 4 skulls out of 20 times is about 0.20 (the actual answer is 0.2022036). In other words, you’d expect that to happen about 20% of the times you repeated this experiment. Table 6.2: Formulas for the binomial and normal distributions. We don’t use these formulas for anything in this book, but they’re pretty important for more advanced work. In the equation for the binomial, \\(X!\\) is the factorial function (i.e., multiply all whole numbers from 1 to \\(X\\)), and for the normal distribution “exp” refers to the exponential function, which we discussed in the Chapter on Data Handling. If these equations don’t make a lot of sense to you, don’t worry too much about them. Binomial Normal \\(P(X | \\theta, N) = \\displaystyle\\frac{N!}{X! (N-X)!} \\theta^X (1-\\theta)^{N-X}\\) \\(p(X | \\mu, \\sigma) = \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(X - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\\) Figure 6.3: The binomial distribution with size parameter of \\(N=20\\) and an underlying success probability of \\(theta = 1/6\\). Each vertical bar depicts the probability of one specific outcome (i.e., one possible value of \\(X\\)). Because this is a probability distribution, each of the probabilities must be a number between 0 and 1, and the heights of the bars must sum to 1 as well. 6.4.2 The normal distribution While the binomial distribution is conceptually the simplest distribution to understand, it’s not the most important one. That particular honour goes to the normal distribution, which is also referred to as “the bell curve” or “Gaussian distribution”. A normal distribution is described using two parameters, the mean of the distribution \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation of the distribution \\(\\sigma\\). The notation that we sometimes use to say that a variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma) \\] Of course, that’s just notation. It doesn’t tell us anything interesting about the normal distribution itself. As was the case with the binomial distribution, the formula for the normal distribution in this book is tucked away in Table 6.2. Instead of focusing on the maths, let’s try to understand what it means for a variable to be normally distributed. To that end, have a look at Figure 6.4, which plots a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1\\). You can see where the name “bell curve” comes from: it looks a bit like a bell. Notice that, unlike the plots to illustrate the binomial distribution, the picture of the normal distribution in Figure 6.4 shows a smooth curve instead of “histogram-like” bars. This isn’t an arbitrary choice: the normal distribution is continuous, whereas the binomial is discrete. For instance, in the die rolling example from the last section, it was possible to get 3 skulls or 4 skulls, but impossible to get 3.9 skulls. The figures in the previous section reflected this fact: in Figure 6.3, for instance, there’s a bar located at \\(X=3\\) and another one at \\(X=4\\), but there’s nothing in between. Continuous quantities don’t have this constraint. For instance, suppose we’re talking about the weather. The temperature on a pleasant Spring day could be 23 degrees, 24 degrees, 23.9 degrees, or anything in between since temperature is a continuous variable, and so a normal distribution might be quite appropriate for describing Spring temperatures.20 Figure 6.4: The normal distribution with mean \\(mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma = 1\\). The \\(x\\)-axis corresponds to the value of some variable, and the \\(y\\)-axis tells us something about how likely we are to observe that value. However, notice that the \\(y\\)-axis is labelled “Probability Density” and not “Probability”. There is a subtle and somewhat frustrating characteristic of continuous distributions that makes the \\(y\\) axis behave a bit oddly: the height of the curve here isn’t actually the probability of observing a particular \\(x\\) value. On the other hand, it is true that the heights of the curve tells you which \\(x\\) values are more likely (the higher ones!). With this in mind, let’s see if we can’t get an intuition for how the normal distribution works. Firstly, let’s have a look at what happens when we play around with the parameters of the distribution. To that end, Figure 6.5 plots normal distributions that have different means, but have the same standard deviation. As you might expect, all of these distributions have the same “width”. The only difference between them is that they’ve been shifted to the left or to the right. In every other respect, they’re identical. In contrast, if we increase the standard deviation while keeping the mean constant, the peak of the distribution stays in the same place, but the distribution gets wider, as you can see in Figure 6.6. Notice, though, that when we widen the distribution, the height of the peak shrinks. This has to happen: in the same way that the heights of the bars that we used to draw a discrete binomial distribution have to sum to 1, the total area under the curve for the normal distribution must equal 1. Figure 6.5: An illustration of what happens when you change the mean of a normal distribution. The solid line depicts a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=4\\). The dashed line shows a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=7\\). In both cases, the standard deviation is \\(sigma=1\\). Not surprisingly, the two distributions have the same shape, but the dashed line is shifted to the right. Figure 6.6: An illustration of what happens when you change the the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Both distributions plotted in this figure have a mean of \\(mu = 5\\), but they have different standard deviations. The solid line plots a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\), and the dashed line shows a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma = 2\\). As a consequence, both distributions are “centred” on the same spot, but the dashed line is wider than the solid one. Before moving on, there is one important characteristic of the normal distribution to point out. Irrespective of the actual mean and standard deviation, 68.3% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Similarly, 95.4% of the distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the distribution is within 3 standard deviations. This idea is illustrated in Figures 6.7 and 6.8. Figure 6.7: The area under the curve tells you the probability that an observation falls within a particular range. The solid lines plot normal distributions with mean \\(mu=0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\) The shaded areas illustrate “areas under the curve” for two important cases. On the left, we can see that there is a 68.3% chance that an observation will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. On the right, we see that there is a 95.4% chance that an observation will fall within two standard deviations of the mean Figure 6.8: Two more examples of the “area under the curve idea”. There is a 15.9% chance that an observation is one standard deviation below the mean or smaller (left), and a 34.1% chance that the observation is greater than one standard deviation below the mean but still below the mean (right). Notice that if you add these two numbers together you get 15.9% + 34.1% = 50%. For normally distributed data, there is a 50% chance that an observation falls below the mean. And of course that also implies that there is a 50% chance that it falls above the mean. 6.4.3 Probability density There’s something we missed throughout the discussion of the normal distribution, something that some introductory textbooks omit completely. Fortunately, it’s not something that you need to understand at a deep level in order to do basic statistics: rather, it’s something that starts to become important later on when you move beyond the basics. So, if it doesn’t make complete sense, don’t worry: try to make sure that you follow the gist of it. There have been one or two things that don’t quite make sense. Perhaps you noticed that the \\(y\\)-axis in these figures is labelled “Probability Density” rather than density. Maybe you noticed that we used \\(p(X)\\) instead of \\(P(X)\\) when giving the formula for the normal distribution. Let us spend a little time thinking about what it really means to say that \\(X\\) is a continuous variable. Let’s say we’re talking about the temperature outside. The thermometer tells me it’s 23 degrees, but we know that’s not really true. It’s not exactly 23 degrees. Maybe it’s 23.1 degrees. But we know that that’s not really true either, because it might actually be 23.09 degrees. But, we know that… well, you get the idea. The tricky thing with genuinely continuous quantities is that you never really know exactly what they are. Now think about what this implies when we talk about probabilities. Suppose that tomorrow’s maximum temperature is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 23 and standard deviation 1. What’s the probability that the temperature will be exactly 23 degrees? The answer is “zero”, or possibly, “a number so close to zero that it might as well be zero”. Why is this? It’s like trying to throw a dart at an infinitely small dart board: no matter how good your aim, you’ll never hit it. In real life, you’ll never get a value of exactly 23. It’ll always be something like 23.1 or 22.99998 or something. In other words, it’s completely meaningless to talk about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees. However, in everyday language, if we say that it was 23 degrees outside and turned out to be 22.9998 degrees, you probably wouldn’t make a fuss. Because in everyday language, “23 degrees” usually means something like “somewhere between 22.5 and 23.5 degrees”. And while it doesn’t feel very meaningful to ask about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees, it does seem sensible to ask about the probability that the temperature lies between 22.5 and 23.5, or between 20 and 30, or any other range of temperatures. The point of this discussion is to make clear that, when we’re talking about continuous distributions, it’s not meaningful to talk about the probability of a specific value. However, what we can talk about is the probability that the value lies within a particular range of values. To find out the probability associated with a particular range, what you need to do is calculate the “area under the curve”. We’ve seen this concept already: in Figure 6.7, the shaded areas shown depict genuine probabilities (e.g., in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.7, it shows the probability of observing a value that falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean). Okay, so that explains part of the story. We’ve explained a little bit about how continuous probability distributions should be interpreted (i.e., the area under the curve is the key thing), but we haven’t actually explained what the formula for \\(p(x)\\) actually means. Obviously, \\(p(x)\\) doesn’t describe a probability, but what is it? The name for this quantity \\(p(x)\\) is a probability density, and in terms of the plots we’ve been drawing, it corresponds to the height of the curve. The densities themselves aren’t meaningful in and of themselves: but they’re “rigged” to ensure that the area under the curve is always interpretable as genuine probabilities. To be honest, that’s about as much as you really need to know for now. For those readers who know a little calculus, let’s give a slightly more precise explanation. In the same way that probabilities are non-negative numbers that must sum to 1, probability densities are non-negative numbers that must integrate to 1 (where the integral is taken across all possible values of \\(X\\)). To calculate the probability that \\(X\\) falls between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we calculate the definite integral of the density function over the corresponding range, \\(\\int_a^b p(x) \\ dx\\). If you don’t remember or never learned calculus, don’t worry about this. It’s not needed for this book. 6.4.4 Other useful distributions The normal distribution is the distribution that statistics makes the most use of (for reasons to be discussed shortly), and the binomial distribution is handy for many purposes. But the world of statistics is filled with probability distributions, some of which we’ll run into in passing. In particular, the three that will appear in this book are the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. We won’t give formulas for any of these or talk about them in too much detail, but we will show you some pictures. The \\(t\\) distribution is a continuous distribution that looks very similar to a normal distribution but has heavier tails: see Figure 6.9. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you don’t know the mean or standard deviation. We’ll run into this distribution again in Chapter ??. Figure 6.9: A \\(t\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (solid line). It looks similar to a normal distribution, but it’s not quite the same. For comparison purposes, we’ve plotted a standard normal distribution as the dashed line. Note that the “tails” of the \\(t\\) distribution are “heavier” (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution? That’s the important difference between the two. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is another distribution that turns up in lots of different places. The situation in which we’ll see it is when doing categorical data analysis (Chapter ??), but it’s one of those things that actually pops up all over the place. When you dig into the maths (and who doesn’t love doing that?), it turns out that the main reason why the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution turns up all over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred to as taking a “sum of squares”), this sum has a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. You’d be amazed how often this fact turns out to be useful. Anyway, here’s what a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution looks like: Figure 6.10. Figure 6.10: A \\(chi^2\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. Notice that the observed values must always be greater than zero, and that the distribution is pretty skewed. These are the key features of a chi-square distribution. The \\(F\\) distribution looks a bit like a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution, and it arises whenever you need to compare two \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions to one another. Admittedly, this doesn’t exactly sound like something that any sane person would want to do, but it turns out to be very important in real-world data analysis. Remember when we said that \\(\\chi^2\\) turns out to be the key distribution when we’re taking a “sum of squares”? Well, what that means is if you want to compare two different “sums of squares”, you’re probably talking about something that has an \\(F\\) distribution. Of course, we still haven’t given you an example of anything involving a sum of squares, but we will in Chapter ??. And that’s where we’ll run into the \\(F\\) distribution. Oh, and here’s a picture: Figure 6.11. Figure 6.11: An \\(F\\) distribution with 3 and 5 degrees of freedom. Qualitatively speaking, it looks pretty similar to a chi-square distribution, but they’re not quite the same in general. They’re all continuous distributions, and they’re all closely related to the normal distribution. The key thing for our purposes, however, is not that you have a deep understanding of all these different distributions, nor that you remember the precise relationships between them. The main thing is that you grasp the basic idea that these distributions are all deeply related to one another and to the normal distribution. Later on, we’re going to run into data that are normally distributed or at least assumed to be normally distributed. What you have to understand right now is that if you make the assumption that your data are normally distributed, you shouldn’t be surprised to see \\(\\chi^2\\), \\(t\\) and \\(F\\) distributions popping up all over the place when you start trying to do your data analysis. 6.5 Summary In this chapter we’ve talked about probability. We’ve talked what probability means, and why statisticians can’t agree on what it means. We talked about the rules that probabilities have to obey. And we introduced the idea of a probability distribution, and we spent a good portion of the chapter talking about some of the more important probability distributions that statisticians work with. The section by section breakdown looks like this: Probability theory versus statistics (Section 6.1) Frequentist versus Bayesian views of probability (Section 6.2) Basics of probability theory (Section 6.3) Binomial distribution (Section 6.4.1), normal distribution (Section 6.4.2), and others (Section 6.4.4) Many undergraduate psychology classes on statistics skim over this content very quickly, and even the more advanced courses will often “forget” to revisit the basic foundations of the field. Most academic psychologists would not know the difference between probability and density; until recently, very few would have been aware of the difference between Bayesian and frequentist probability. However, it’s essential to understand these things before moving on to the applications. For example, there are a lot of rules about what you’re “allowed” to say when making statistical inferences, and many of these can seem arbitrary and weird. However, they start to make sense if you understand this Bayesian/frequentist distinction. Similarly, in Chapter ?? we’re going to talk about something called the \\(t\\)-test, and if you really want to have a grasp of the mechanics of the \\(t\\)-test it really helps to have a sense of what a \\(t\\)-distribution actually looks like. You get the idea. This doesn’t mean that frequentists can’t make hypothetical statements, of course; it’s just that if you want to make a statement about probability, then it must be possible to redescribe that statement in terms of a sequence of potentially observable events, and the relative frequencies of different outcomes that appear within that sequence.↩︎ Note that the term “success” is pretty arbitrary and doesn’t actually imply that the outcome is something to be desired. If \\(\\theta\\) referred to the probability that any one passenger gets injured in a bus crash, it is still called the success probability.↩︎ In practice, the normal distribution is so handy that people tend to use it even when the variable isn’t actually continuous. As long as there are enough categories (e.g., Likert scale responses to a questionnaire), it’s pretty standard practice to use the normal distribution as an approximation. This works out much better in practice than you’d think.↩︎ "],["estimation.html", "Chapter 7 Population, sampling, estimation 7.1 Samples, populations and sampling 7.2 The law of large numbers 7.3 Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem 7.4 Estimating population parameters 7.5 Estimating a confidence interval 7.6 Population parameter estimations in CogStat 7.7 Summary", " Chapter 7 Population, sampling, estimation As discussed in Chapter 4, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise what we do know. In contrast, inferential statistics aims to “learn what we do not know from what we do”. Now that we have a foundation in probability theory, we are in a good position to think about the problem of statistical inference. What kinds of things would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them? These questions lie at the heart of inferential statistics and are traditionally divided into two “big ideas”: estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal of this chapter is to introduce sampling theory first because, later on, estimation theory doesn’t make sense until you understand sampling. 7.1 Samples, populations and sampling All learning requires you to make assumptions. Accepting this is true, our first task is to come up with some fairly general assumptions about data that make sense. If probability theory is the foundation upon which all statistical theory builds, sampling theory is the frame around which you can build the rest of the house. It plays a massive role in specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely. And to talk about “making inferences” the way statisticians think about it, we need to be a bit more explicit about what it is that we’re drawing inferences from (the sample) and what it is that we’re drawing inferences about (the population). In almost every situation of interest, we have a sample of data available to us as researchers. We might have run an experiment with some number of participants; a polling company might have phoned some number of people to ask questions about voting intentions; etc. Regardless: the data set available to us is finite and incomplete. We can’t possibly get every person in the world to do our experiment; a polling company doesn’t have the time or the money to ring up every voter in the country etc. In our earlier discussion of descriptive statistics (Chapter 4, this sample was the only thing we were interested in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, summarising and graphing that sample. This is about to change. 7.1.1 Defining a population A sample is a tangible thing. You can open up a data file, and there you have data from your sample. A population, on the other hand, is a more abstract idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible observations, that you want to draw conclusions about and is generally much bigger than the sample. In an ideal world, the researcher would begin the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is since the process of designing a study and testing hypotheses about the data that it produces does depend on the population about which you want to make statements. However, that doesn’t always happen in practice: usually, the researcher has a relatively vague idea of what the population is and designs the study as best they can on that basis. Sometimes it’s easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in the “polling company” example that opened the chapter, the population consisted of all voters enrolled at the time of the study – millions of people. The sample was a set of 1000 people belonging to that population. In most cases, the situation is much less simple. Determining the population of interest in a typical psychological experiment is a bit more complicated. Suppose we run an experiment using 100 undergraduate students as our participants. Our goal, as cognitive scientists, is to try to learn something about how the mind works. So, which of the following would count as “the population”: All of the undergraduate psychology students at the University of Adelaide? Undergraduate psychology students in general, anywhere in the world? Australians currently living? Australians of similar ages to my sample? Anyone currently alive? Any human being, past, present or future? Any biological organism with sufficient intelligence operating in a terrestrial environment? Any intelligent being? Each of these defines a real group of mind-possessing entities, all of which might be of interest, and it’s not clear which one should be the true population of interest. 7.1.2 Simple random samples Figure 7.1: Simple random sampling without replacement from a finite population Irrespective of how we define the population, the critical point is that the sample is a subset of the population. Our goal is to use our knowledge of the sample to draw inferences about the properties of the population. The relationship between the two depends on the procedure by which the sample was selected. This procedure is referred to as a sampling method, and it is important to understand why it matters. To keep things simple, let’s imagine that we have a bag containing 10 chips. Each chip has a unique letter printed on it, so we can distinguish between the 10 chips. The chips come in two colours, black and white. This set of chips is the population of interest, and it is depicted graphically on the left of Figure 7.1. As you can see from looking at the picture, there are 4 black chips and 6 white chips, but of course, in real life, we wouldn’t know that unless we looked in the bag. Now imagine you run the following “experiment”: you shake up the bag, close your eyes, and pull out 4 chips without putting any of them back into the bag. First out comes the \\(a\\) chip (black), then the \\(c\\) chip (white), then \\(j\\) (white) and then finally \\(b\\) (black). If you wanted, you could then put all the chips back in the bag and repeat the experiment, as depicted on the right-hand side of Figure 7.1. Each time you get different results, but the procedure is identical in each case. The fact that the same procedure can lead to different results each time, we refer to it as a random process.21 However, because we shook the bag before pulling any chips out, it seems reasonable to think that every chip has the same chance of being selected. A procedure in which every member of the population has the same chance of being selected is called a simple random sample. The fact that we did not put the chips back in the bag after pulling them out means that you can’t observe the same thing twice, and in such cases, the observations are said to have been sampled without replacement. To help make sure you understand the importance of the sampling procedure, consider an alternative way the experiment could have been run. Suppose a 5-year-old had opened the bag and decided to pull out four black chips without putting any of them back in the bag. This biased sampling scheme is depicted in Figure 7.2. Now consider the evidentiary value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips. Clearly, it depends on the sampling scheme. If you know that the sampling scheme is biased to select only black chips, then a sample that consists of only black chips doesn’t tell you very much about the population! For this reason, statisticians really like it when a data set can be considered a simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis much easier. Figure 7.2: Biased sampling without replacement from a finite population Figure 7.3: Simple random sampling with replacement from a finite population A third procedure is worth mentioning. We close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip this time. This time, however, we record the observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random samples, but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after drawing them, it is referred to as a sample with replacement. The difference between this situation and the first one is that it is possible to observe the same population member multiple times, as illustrated in Figure 7.3. Most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without replacement because the same person is not allowed to participate in the experiment twice. However, most statistical theories are based on the assumption that the data arise from a simple random sample with replacement. In real life, this very rarely matters. If the population of interest is large (e.g., has much more than 10 entities!), the difference between sampling with and without replacement is too small to be concerned with. The difference between simple random samples and biased samples, on the other hand, is not such an easy thing to dismiss. 7.1.3 Most samples are not simple random samples As you can see from the list of possible populations above, it is almost impossible to obtain a simple random sample from most populations of interest. A thorough discussion of other types of sampling schemes is beyond the scope of this book, but to give you a sense of what’s out there, here’s a list of a few of the more important ones: Stratified sampling. Suppose your population can be divided into several subpopulations, or strata. Perhaps you’re running a study at different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample randomly from the population as a whole, you try to collect a separate random sample from each stratum. Stratified sampling is sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the population is already divided into distinct strata. It can also be more efficient than simple random sampling, especially when some subpopulations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia, it would be much better to divide the population into two22 strata (schizophrenic and not-schizophrenic), and then sample an equal number of people from each group. If you selected people randomly, you would get so few schizophrenic people in the sample that your study would be useless. This specific kind of stratified sampling is called oversampling because it deliberately attempts to over-represent rare groups. Snowball sampling is a technique that is especially useful when sampling from a “hidden” or hard-to-access population and is widespread in social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey, the participants are asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to participate. In stage 2, those new contacts are surveyed. The process continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The advantage of snowball sampling is that it lets access data in situations that might otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random. On the real-life side, the disadvantage is that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well because hidden populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an example here to highlight this. If you weren’t careful, you might end up outing people who don’t want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even if you don’t make that mistake, it can still be intrusive to use people’s social networks to study them. It’s undoubtedly tough to get people’s informed consent before contacting them, yet in many cases, the simple act of contacting them and saying, “hi, we want to study you”, can be hurtful. Social networks are complex, and just because you can use them to get data doesn’t always mean you should. Convenience sampling is more or less what it sounds. The samples are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected at random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These samples are generally non-random in two respects: firstly, reliance on undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are restricted to a single subpopulation. Secondly, the students usually get to pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self-selected subset of psychology students, not a randomly selected subset. In real life, most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is sometimes a severe limitation, but not always. 7.1.4 How much does it matter if you don’t have a simple random sample? Okay, so real-world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that it can matter if your data are not a simple random sample: think about the difference between Figures 7.1 and 7.2. However, it’s not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples are entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling technique, you know what the bias is because you created it deliberately, often to increase the effectiveness of your study. So in those situations, it’s not a problem. Also, there are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases you’ve introduced, but they are not covered in this book. More generally, it’s important to remember that random sampling is a means to an end, not the end itself. Let’s assume you’ve relied on a convenience sample; as such, you can assume it’s biased. A bias in your sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, I’d argue that we don’t need the sample to be randomly generated in every respect: we only need it to be random for the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of interest. Suppose we’re doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In study 1, we can sample randomly from all human beings currently alive, with one exception: we can only sample people born on a Monday. In study 2, we are able to sample randomly from the Australian population. We want to generalise my results to the population of all living humans. Which study is better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? Because we have no reason to think that being “born on a Monday” has any interesting relationship to working memory capacity. In contrast, we can think of several reasons why “being Australian” might matter. Australia is a wealthy, industrialised country with a very well-developed education system. People growing up in that system will have had life experiences much more similar to the experiences of the people who designed the tests for working memory capacity. This shared experience might easily translate into similar beliefs about how to “take a test”, a shared assumption about how psychological experimentation works, and so on. These things might actually matter. For instance, the “test-taking” style might have taught the Australian participants how to direct their attention exclusively on somewhat abstract test materials relative to people who haven’t grown up in a similar environment, leading to a misleading picture of working memory capacity. There are two points hidden in this discussion. Firstly, when designing your studies, you must consider what population you care about and try hard to sample in a way appropriate to that population. In practice, you’re usually forced to put up with a “sample of convenience” (e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because that’s the least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers aren’t exactly overflowing with gold). But you should at least spend some time thinking about the dangers of this practice. Secondly, if you’re criticising someone else’s study because they’ve used a sample of convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from the entire human population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific theory as to how this might have distorted the results. Remember, everyone in science knows this issue and does what they can to alleviate it. Merely pointing out that “the study only included people from group BLAH” is entirely unhelpful and borders on insulting the researchers, who are, of course, aware of the issue. They just don’t happen to own the infinite supply of time and money required to construct the perfect sample. In short, if you want to offer a responsible critique of the sampling process, then be helpful. 7.1.5 Population parameters and sample statistics Let’s consider a slightly different case by setting aside the thorny methodological issues associated with obtaining a random sample and my rather unfortunate tendency to rant about lazy methodological criticism. Up to this point, we have been talking about populations the way a scientist might: a population might be a group of people to a psychologist; to an ecologist, a population might be a group of bears. In most cases, the populations that scientists care about are tangible things that exist in the real world. Statisticians are interested in real-world data and actual science the same way scientists are. On the other hand, they also operate in the realm of pure abstraction as mathematicians do. Consequently, statistical theory tends to be a bit abstract in how a population is defined. In much the same way that psychological researchers operationalise our abstract theoretical ideas in terms of concrete measurements (Section 3.1, statisticians operationalise the concept of a “population” in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work with. You’ve already come across these objects in Chapter 6: they’re called probability distributions. The idea is quite simple. Let’s say we’re talking about IQ scores. To a psychologist, the population of interest is a group of actual humans with IQ scores. A statistician “simplifies” this by operationally defining the population as the probability distribution depicted in Figure 7.4. IQ tests are designed so that the average IQ is 100, the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15, and the distribution of IQ scores is normal. These values are referred to as the population parameters because they are characteristics of the entire population. That is, we say that the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is 100, and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is 15. Figure 7.4: The population distribution of IQ scores. Now let us run an experiment. We select 100 people at random and administer an IQ test, giving us a simple random sample from the population. The sample would consist of a collection of numbers like this: 106 101 98 80 74 ... 107 72 100 Figure 7.5: A sample of 100 observations drawn from the population distribution of IQ scores. Each IQ score is sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. So if we plot a histogram of the sample, we get something like the one shown in Figure 7.5. As you can see, the histogram is roughly the proper shape, but it’s a very crude approximation to the actual population distribution shown in Figure 7.4. When calculating the mean of the sample, we get a number that is relatively close to the population mean of 100 but not identical. In this case, it turns out that the people in the sample have a mean IQ of 98.5, and the standard deviation of their IQ scores is 15.9. These sample statistics are properties of our data set, and although they are reasonably similar to the actual population values, they are not the same. In general, sample statistics are the things you can calculate from your data set, and the population parameters are the things you want to learn about. 7.2 The law of large numbers In the previous section, we discussed the results of one fictitious IQ experiment with a sample size of \\(N=100\\). The results were somewhat encouraging: the true population mean was 100, and the sample mean of 98.5 was a reasonable approximation. In many scientific studies, that level of precision is perfectly acceptable, but in other situations, you need to be much more precise. If we want our sample statistics to be much closer to the population parameters, what can we do about it? The obvious answer is to collect more data. Suppose that we ran a much larger experiment, this time measuring the IQs of 10,000 people. For an experiment with a sample size of n = 10000, and a population with mean = 100 and sd = 15, we get the following distribution: Figure 7.6: A sample of 10,000 observations drawn from the population distribution of IQ scores. Large samples generally give you better information. It feels silly saying it because it’s so bloody obvious that it shouldn’t need to be said. It’s such an obvious point that when Jacob Bernoulli – one of the founders of probability theory – formalised this idea back in 1713, he was kind of a jerk about it. Here’s how he described the fact that we all share this intuition: For even the most stupid of men, by some instinct of nature, by himself and without any instruction (which is a remarkable thing), is convinced that the more observations have been made, the less danger there is of wandering from one’s goal. Stigler (1986) Okay, so the passage comes across as a bit condescending (not to mention sexist), but his main point is correct: it really does feel evident that more data will give you better answers. The question is, why is this so? Not surprisingly, this intuition we all share is correct, and statisticians refer to it as the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that applies to many different sample statistics, but the simplest way to think about it is as a law about averages. The sample mean is the most obvious example of a statistic that relies on averaging (because that’s what the mean is – an average), so let’s look at that. When applied to the sample mean, the law of large numbers states that as the sample gets larger, the sample mean tends to get closer to the true population mean. Or, to say it a little bit more precisely, as the sample size “approaches” infinity (written as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) the sample mean approaches the population mean (\\(\\bar{X} \\rightarrow \\mu\\)).23 You won’t be subject to proof that the law of large numbers is true, but it’s one of the most important tools for statistical theory. The law of large numbers is the thing we can use to justify our belief that collecting more and more data will eventually lead us to the truth. For any particular data set, the sample statistics that we calculate from it will be wrong, but the law of large numbers tells us that if we keep collecting more data, those sample statistics will tend to get closer and closer to the true population parameters. 7.3 Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem The law of large numbers is a potent tool, but it will not be good enough to answer all our questions. Among other things, it gives us a “long-run guarantee”. In the long run, if we could collect an infinite amount of data, then the law of large numbers guarantees that our sample statistics will be correct. But as John Maynard Keynes famously argued in economics, a long-run guarantee is of little use in real life: [The] long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task, if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us, that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again. Keynes (1923) As in economics, so too in psychology and statistics. It is not enough to know that we will eventually arrive at the right answer when calculating the sample mean. Knowing that an infinitely large data set will tell me the exact value of the population mean is cold comfort when my actual data set has a sample size of \\(N=100\\). In real life, then, we must know something about the behaviour of the sample mean when it is calculated from a more modest data set! 7.3.1 Sampling distribution of the mean With this in mind, let’s abandon the idea that our studies will have sample sizes of 10000 and consider a very modest experiment indeed. This time around, we’ll sample \\(N=5\\) people and measure their IQ scores. 90 82 94 99 110 The mean IQ in this sample turns out to be exactly 95. Not surprisingly, this is much less accurate than the previous experiment. Now imagine that we decided to replicate the experiment. That is, we repeat the procedure as closely as possible: randomly sample 5 new people and measure their IQ. 78 88 111 111 117 This time around, the mean IQ in the sample is 101. If we repeat the experiment 10 times, we obtain the results shown in Table 7.1, and as you can see, the sample mean varies from one replication to the next. Table 7.1: Ten replications of the IQ experiment, each with a sample size of \\(N=5\\). Replication Person 1 Person 2 Person 3 Person 4 Person 5 Sample Mean Replication 1 90 82 94 99 110 95.0 Replication 2 78 88 111 111 117 101.0 Replication 3 111 122 91 98 86 101.6 Replication 4 98 96 119 99 107 103.8 Replication 5 105 113 103 103 98 104.4 Replication 6 81 89 93 85 114 92.4 Replication 7 100 93 108 98 133 106.4 Replication 8 107 100 105 117 85 102.8 Replication 9 86 119 108 73 116 100.4 Replication 10 95 126 112 120 76 105.8 Suppose we decided to keep going in this fashion, replicating this “five IQ scores” experiment repeatedly. Every time we replicate the experiment, we write down the sample mean. Over time, we should be amassing a new data set in which every experiment generates a single data point. The first 10 observations from the data set are the sample means listed in Table 7.1, so our data set starts out like this: 95.0 101.0 101.6 103.8 104.4 ... What if we should continue like this for 10,000 replications and then draw a histogram? As Figure 7.7 illustrates, the average of 5 IQ scores is usually between 90 and 110. But more importantly, what it highlights is that if we replicate an experiment over and over again, what we end up with is a distribution of sample means! This distribution has a particular name in statistics: the sampling distribution of the mean. Sampling distributions are another important theoretical idea in statistics, and they’re crucial for understanding the behaviour of small samples. For instance, when we ran the very first “five IQ scores” experiment, the sample mean turned out to be 95. What the sampling distribution in Figure 7.7 tells us, though, is that the “five IQ scores” experiment is not very accurate. If we repeat the experiment, the sampling distribution tells me that we can expect to see a sample mean anywhere between 80 and 120. Figure 7.7: The sampling distribution of the mean for the “five IQ scores experiment”. If you sample 5 people at random and calculate their average IQ, you’ll almost certainly get a number between 80 and 120, even though there are quite a lot of individuals who have IQs above 120 or below 80. For comparison, the black line plots the population distribution of IQ scores. 7.3.2 Sampling distributions exist for any sample statistic! One thing to remember when thinking about sampling distributions is that any sample statistic you might care to calculate has a sampling distribution. For example, suppose that each time we replicated the “five IQ scores” experiment, we wrote down the largest IQ score in the experiment. This would give us a data set that started out like this: 110 117 122 119 113 ... Doing this over and over again would give a very different sampling distribution, namely the sampling distribution of the maximum. The sampling distribution of the maximum of 5 IQ scores is shown in Figure 7.8. Not surprisingly, if you pick 5 people at random and then find the person with the highest IQ score, they’re going to have an above-average IQ. Most of the time, you’ll end up with someone whose IQ is measured in the 100 to 140 range. Figure 7.8: The sampling distribution of the maximum for the “five IQ scores experiment”. If you sample 5 people at random and select the one with the highest IQ score, you’ll probably see someone with an IQ between 100 and 140. 7.3.3 The central limit theorem Here’s an illustration of how the sampling distribution of the mean depends on the sample size. In each panel, there are 10,000 generated samples of IQ data and the mean IQ observed within each set. The histograms in these plots show the distribution of these means (i.e. the sampling distribution of the mean). Each individual IQ score was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15, which is shown as the solid black line). Figure 7.9: Each data set contained only a single observation, so the mean of each sample is just one person’s IQ score. As a consequence, the sampling distribution of the mean is of course identical to the population distribution of IQ scores. Figure 7.10: When we raise the sample size to 2, the mean of any one sample tends to be closer to the population mean than a one person’s IQ score, and so the histogram (i.e., the sampling distribution) is a bit narrower than the population distribution. Figure 7.11: By the time we raise the sample size to 10, we can see that the distribution of sample means tend to be fairly tightly clustered around the true population mean. At this point, you have a pretty good sense of what sampling distributions are, particularly the sampling distribution of the mean. In this section, let us talk about how the sampling distribution of the mean changes as a function of sample size. Intuitively, you already know part of the answer: if you only have a few observations, the sample mean is likely to be quite inaccurate: if you replicate a small experiment and recalculate the mean, you’ll get a very different answer. In other words, the sampling distribution is quite broad. If you replicate a large experiment and recalculate the sample mean, you’ll probably get the same answer you got last time, so the sampling distribution will narrow. You can see this visually in Figures 7.9, 7.10 and 7.11: the bigger the sample size, the narrower the sampling distribution gets. We can quantify this effect by calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is referred to as the standard error. The standard error of a statistic is often denoted SE, and since we’re usually interested in the standard error of the sample mean, we often use the acronym SEM. As you can see just by looking at the picture, as the sample size \\(N\\) increases, the SEM decreases. However, there’s something we’ve been glossing over so far. All examples up to this point have been based on the “IQ scores” experiments. And because IQ scores are roughly normally distributed, we’ve assumed that the population distribution is normal. What if it isn’t normal? What happens to the sampling distribution of the mean? The remarkable thing is this: no matter what shape your population distribution is, as \\(N\\) increases the sampling distribution of the mean starts to look more like a normal distribution. To give you a sense of this, let’s run some simulations. We start with the “ramped” distribution shown in the histogram in Figure 7.12. As you can see by comparing the triangular-shaped histogram to the bell curve plotted by the black line, the population distribution doesn’t look very much like a normal distribution at all. Next, let us simulate the results of a large number of experiments. In each experiment, we draw \\(N=2\\) samples from this distribution and then calculate the sample mean. Figure 7.12 panel b plots the histogram of these sample means (i.e. the sampling distribution of the mean for \\(N=2\\)). This time, the histogram produces a \\(\\cap\\)-shaped distribution: it’s still not normal, but it’s a lot closer to the black line than the population distribution in Figure 7.12 panel a. When we increase the sample size to \\(N=4\\), the sampling distribution of the mean is very close to normal (Figure 7.12 panel c), and by the time we reach a sample size of \\(N=8\\) it’s almost perfectly normal. In other words, as long as your sample size isn’t tiny, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal no matter what your population distribution looks like! Figure 7.12: A demonstration of the central limit theorem. In panel a, we have a non-normal population distribution; and panels b-d show the sampling distribution of the mean for samples of size 2,4 and 8, for data drawn from the distribution in panel a. As you can see, even though the original population distribution is non-normal, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes pretty close to normal by the time you have a sample of even 4 observations. Based on these figures, it seems like we have evidence for all of the following claims about the sampling distribution of the mean: The mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the mean of the population The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error) gets smaller as the sample size increases The shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal as the sample size increases As it happens, not only are all of these statements true, there is a very famous theorem in statistics that proves all three of them, known as the central limit theorem. Among other things, the central limit theorem tells us that if the population distribution has mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), then the sampling distribution of the mean also has mean \\(\\mu\\), and the standard error of the mean is \\[ \\mbox{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{ \\sqrt{N} } \\] Because we divide the population standard devation \\(\\sigma\\) by the square root of the sample size \\(N\\), the SEM gets smaller as the sample size increases. It also tells us that the shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal.24 This result is useful for all sorts of things. It tells us why large experiments are more reliable than small ones, and because it gives us an explicit formula for the standard error, it tells us how much more reliable a large experiment is. It tells us why the normal distribution is, well, normal. In real experiments, many of the things that we want to measure are averages of lots of different quantities (e.g. arguably, “general” intelligence as measured by IQ is an average of a large number of “specific” skills and abilities), and when that happens, the averaged quantity should follow a normal distribution. Because of this mathematical law, the normal distribution pops up over and over again in real data. 7.4 Estimating population parameters In all the IQ examples in the previous sections, we knew the population parameters ahead of time. As every undergraduate gets taught in their first lecture on the measurement of intelligence, IQ scores are defined to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. However, this is a bit of a lie. How do we know that IQ scores have a true population mean of 100? Well, we know this because the people who designed the tests have administered them to very large samples, and have then “rigged” the scoring rules so that their sample has mean 100. That’s not a bad thing of course: it’s an important part of designing a psychological measurement. However, it’s important to keep in mind that this theoretical mean of 100 only attaches to the population that the test designers used to design the tests. Good test designers will actually go to some lengths to provide “test norms” that can apply to lots of different populations (e.g., different age groups, nationalities etc.). This is very handy, but of course, almost every research project of interest involves looking at a different population of people to those used in the test norms. For instance, suppose you wanted to measure the effect of low-level lead poisoning on cognitive functioning in Port Pirie, a South Australian industrial town with a lead smelter. Perhaps you decide that you want to compare IQ scores among people in Port Pirie to a comparable sample in Whyalla, a South Australian industrial town with a steel refinery.25 Regardless of which town you’re thinking about, it doesn’t make a lot of sense simply to assume that the true population mean IQ is 100. No one has produced sensible norming data that can automatically be applied to South Australian industrial towns. We’re going to have to estimate the population parameters from a sample of data. So how do we do this? 7.4.1 Estimating the population mean Suppose we go to Port Pirie and 100 of the locals are kind enough to sit through an IQ test. The average IQ score among these people turns out to be \\(\\bar{X}=98.5\\). So what is the true mean IQ for the entire population of Port Pirie? Obviously, we don’t know the answer to that question. It could be \\(97.2\\), but if could also be \\(103.5\\). Our sampling isn’t exhaustive so we cannot give a definitive answer. Nevertheless if I was forced at gunpoint to give a “best guess” I’d have to say \\(98.5\\). That’s the essence of statistical estimation: giving a best guess. In this example, estimating the unknown poulation parameter is straightforward. I calculate the sample mean, and I use that as my estimate of the population mean. It’s pretty simple, and in the next section I’ll explain the statistical justification for this intuitive answer. However, for the moment what I want to do is make sure you recognise that the sample statistic and the estimate of the population parameter are conceptually different things. A sample statistic is a description of your data, whereas the estimate is a guess about the population. With that in mind, statisticians often different notation to refer to them. For instance, if true population mean is denoted \\(\\mu\\), then we would use \\(\\hat\\mu\\) to refer to our estimate of the population mean. In contrast, the sample mean is denoted \\(\\bar{X}\\) or sometimes \\(m\\). However, in simple random samples, the estimate of the population mean is identical to the sample mean: if I observe a sample mean of \\(\\bar{X} = 98.5\\), then my estimate of the population mean is also \\(\\hat\\mu = 98.5\\). To help keep the notation clear, here’s a handy table: Table 7.2: Notation for sample statistics and estimates of population parameters. Symbol What is it Do we know what it is \\(\\bar{X}\\) Sample mean Yes calculated from the raw data \\(\\mu\\) True population mean Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) Estimate of the population mean Yes identical to the sample mean 7.4.2 Estimating the population standard deviation So far, estimation seems pretty simple, and you might wonder why you must read through all that stuff about sampling theory. In the case of the mean, our estimate of the population parameter (i.e. \\(\\hat\\mu\\)) turned out to be identical to the corresponding sample statistic (i.e. \\(\\bar{X}\\)). However, that’s not always true. To see this, let’s construct an estimate of the population standard deviation, which we’ll denote \\(\\hat\\sigma\\). What shall we use as our estimate in this case? Your first thought might be that we could do the same thing we did when estimating the mean and just use the sample statistic as our estimate. That’s almost the right thing to do, but not quite. Here’s why: Suppose we have a sample that contains a single observation. For this example, it helps to consider a sample where you have no intuitions about the true population values, so let’s use something completely fictitious. Suppose the observation in question measures the cromulence26 of a shoe. It turns out that this shoe has a cromulence of 20. So here’s our sample: 20 This is a legitimate sample, even if it has a sample size of \\(N=1\\). It has a sample mean of 20, and because every observation in this sample is equal to the sample mean (obviously!), it has a sample standard deviation of 0. As a description of the sample this seems quite right: the sample contains a single observation, and therefore there is no variation observed within the sample. A sample standard deviation of \\(s = 0\\) is the right answer here. But as an estimate of the population standard deviation, it feels completely insane, right? Admittedly, we don’t know anything at all about what “cromulence” is, but we know something about data: the only reason that we don’t see any variability in the sample is that the sample is too small to display any variation! So, if you have a sample size of \\(N=1\\), it feels like the right answer is just to say “no idea at all”. Notice that you don’t have the same intuition regarding the sample mean and the population mean. If forced to make the best guess about the population mean, it doesn’t feel completely insane to guess that the population mean is 20. Sure, you probably wouldn’t feel very confident in that guess because you have only one observation to work with, but it’s still the best guess you can make. Let’s extend this example a little. Suppose we now make a second observation. The data set now has \\(N=2\\) observations of the cromulence of shoes, and the complete sample now looks like this: 20 22 This time around, our sample is just large enough for us to observe some variability: two observations is the bare minimum number needed for any variability to be observed! For our new data set, the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}=21\\), and the sample standard deviation is \\(s=1\\). What intuitions do we have about the population? Again, as far as the population mean goes, the best guess we can possibly make is the sample mean: if forced to guess, we’d probably say that the population mean cromulence is 21. What about the standard deviation? This is a little more complicated. The sample standard deviation is only based on two observations, and if you’re at all like me you probably have the intuition that, with only two observations, we haven’t given the population “enough of a chance” to reveal its true variability to us. It’s not just that we suspect that the estimate is wrong: after all, with only two observations, we expect it to be wrong to some degree. The worry is that the error is systematic. Specifically, we suspect that the sample standard deviation is likely to be smaller than the population standard deviation. Figure 7.13: The sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation for a “two IQ scores” experiment. The true population standard deviation is 15 (dashed line), but as you can see from the histogram, the vast majority of experiments will produce a much smaller sample standard deviation than this. On average, this experiment would produce a sample standard deviation of only 8.5, well below the true value! In other words, the sample standard deviation is a biased estimate of the population standard deviation. This intuition feels right, but it would be nice to demonstrate this somehow. There are, in fact, mathematical proofs that confirm this intuition, but unless you have the right mathematical background, they don’t help very much. With that in mind, let’s return to our IQ studies. Suppose the actual population mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. Let’s measure \\(N=2\\) IQ scores and calculate the sample standard deviation. If we do this repeatedly and plot a histogram of these sample standard deviations, we have the sampling distribution of the standard deviation (Figure 7.13). Even though the true population standard deviation is 15, the average of the sample standard deviations is only 8.5. Notice that this is a very different result from what we found in Figure 7.10 when we plotted the sampling distribution of the mean. If you look at that sampling distribution, what you see is that the population mean is 100, and the average of the sample means is also 100. Now let’s extend the simulation. Instead of restricting ourselves to the situation where we have a sample size of \\(N=2\\), let’s repeat the exercise for sample sizes from 1 to 10. If we plot the average sample mean and average sample standard deviation as a function of sample size, you get the results shown in Figure 7.14. On the left side (panel a), you see the average sample mean, and on the right (panel b), the average standard deviation. The two plots are quite different: on average, the average sample mean is equal to the population mean. It is an unbiased estimator, which is essentially why your best estimate for the population mean is the sample mean.27 The plot on the right is quite different: on average, the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) is smaller than the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). It is a biased estimator. In other words, if we want to make a “best guess” \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) about the value of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), we should make sure our guess is a little bit larger than the sample standard deviation \\(s\\). Figure 7.14: An illustration of the fact that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (panel a). Still, the sample standard deviation is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation (panel b). To generate the figure, we have 10,000 simulated data sets with 1 observation each, 10,000 more with 2 observations, and so on up to a sample size of 10. Each data set consisted of fake IQ data: the data were normally distributed with a true population mean of 100 and standard deviation 15. On average, the sample means turn out to be 100, regardless of sample size (panel a). However, the sample standard deviations turn out to be systematically too small (panel b), especially for small sample sizes. The fix to this systematic bias turns out to be very simple. Here’s how it works. Before tackling the standard deviation, let’s look at the variance. If you recall from Section 4.2, the sample variance is defined as the average squared deviations from the sample mean. That is: \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\] The sample variance \\(s^2\\) is a biased estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). But as it turns out, we only need to make a tiny tweak to transform this into an unbiased estimator. All we have to do is divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than by \\(N\\). If we do that, we obtain the following formula: \\[ \\hat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\] This is an unbiased estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma\\), and why statistics software functions prefer \\(\\hat\\sigma^2\\), not \\(s^2\\) when calculating variance. A similar story applies to the standard deviation. If we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\), our estimate of the population standard deviation becomes: \\[ \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2} \\] and when using statistics software, they calculate \\(\\hat\\sigma\\), not \\(s\\).28 One final point: in practice, many people refer to \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) (i.e. the formula where we divide by \\(N-1\\)) as the sample standard deviation. Technically, this is incorrect: the sample standard deviation should be equal to \\(s\\) (i.e. the formula where we divide by \\(N\\)). These aren’t the same thing, either conceptually or numerically. One is a property of the sample, and the other is an estimated characteristic of the population. However, in almost every real-life application, what we care about is the estimate of the population parameter, and so people always report \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) rather than \\(s\\). This is the right number to report, of course. People tend to get a little bit imprecise about terminology when they write it up because “sample standard deviation” is shorter than “estimated population standard deviation”. It’s no big deal, and in practice, many do the same thing everyone else does. Nevertheless, it’s important to keep the two concepts separate: it’s never a good idea to confuse “known properties of your sample” with “guesses about the population from which it came”. The moment you start thinking that \\(s\\) and \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) are the same things, you start doing exactly that. To finish this section off, here’s another couple of tables to help keep things clear: Symbol What is it? Do we know what it is? \\(s\\) Sample standard deviation Yes - calculated from the raw data \\(\\sigma\\) Population standard deviation Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) Estimate of the population standard deviation Yes - but not the same as the sample standard deviation \\(s^2\\) Sample variance Yes - calculated from the raw data \\(\\sigma^2\\) Population variance Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) Estimate of the population variance Yes - but not the same as the sample variance 7.5 Estimating a confidence interval Up to this point in this chapter, we’ve outlined the basics of sampling theory which statisticians rely on to make guesses about population parameters based on a sample of data. As this discussion illustrates, one of the reasons we need all this sampling theory is that every data set leaves us with some uncertainty, so our estimates are never going to be perfectly accurate. The thing missing from this discussion is an attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty that attaches to our estimate. It’s not enough to guess that the mean IQ of undergraduate psychology students is, say, 115. We also want to be able to say something that expresses the degree of certainty that we have in our guess. For example, it would be nice to say that there is a 95% chance that the true mean lies between 109 and 121. The name for this is a confidence interval for the mean. Armed with an understanding of sampling distributions, constructing a confidence interval for the mean is quite easy. Suppose the true population mean is \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma\\). Our study has \\(N\\) participants whose mean IQ is \\(\\bar{X}\\). We know from our discussion of the central limit theorem (Section 7.3.3) that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. We also know from our discussion of the normal distribution (Section 6.4.2) that there is a 95% chance that a normally-distributed quantity will fall within two standard deviations of the true mean. To be more precise, between \\(-1.959964\\) and \\(1.959964\\), meaning the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the normal distribution. So the more correct answer is that there is a 95% chance that a normally-distributed quantity will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the true mean. Next, recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is referred to as the standard error, and the standard error of the mean is written as SEM. When we put all these pieces together, we learn that there is a 95% probability that the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) that we have actually observed lies within 1.96 standard errors of the population mean. Mathematically, we write this as: \\[ \\mu - \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\ \\leq \\ \\bar{X}\\ \\leq \\ \\mu + \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\] where the SEM is equal to \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}\\), and we can be 95% confident that this is true. However, that’s not answering the question that we’re actually interested in. The equation above tells us what we should expect about the sample mean, given that we know the population parameters. What we want is to have this work the other way around: we want to know what we should believe about the population parameters, given that we have observed a particular sample. However, it’s not too difficult to do this. Using a little high school algebra, a sneaky way to rewrite our equation is like this: \\[ \\bar{X} - \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\ \\leq \\ \\mu \\ \\leq \\ \\bar{X} + \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM}\\right) \\] What this is telling is that the range of values has a 95% probability of containing the population mean \\(\\mu\\). We refer to this range as a 95% confidence interval, denoted \\(\\mbox{CI}_{95}\\). In short, as long as \\(N\\) is sufficiently large – large enough for us to believe that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal – then we can write this as our formula for the 95% confidence interval: \\[ \\mbox{CI}_{95} = \\bar{X} \\pm \\left( 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\right) \\] Of course, there’s nothing special about the number 1.96: it just happens to be the multiplier you need to use if you want a 95% confidence interval. If I’d wanted a 70% confidence interval, you have to calculate the 15th and 85th quantiles of the normal distribution, which are \\(-1.036433\\) and \\(1.036433\\). So the formula for \\(\\mbox{CI}_{70}\\) would be the same as the formula for \\(\\mbox{CI}_{95}\\) except that we’d use 1.04 as our magic number rather than 1.96. 7.5.1 A slight mistake in the formula The formula above for the 95% confidence interval is approximately correct, but we glossed over an important detail in the discussion. Notice that it requires you to use the standard error of the mean, SEM, which in turn requires you to use the true population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Yet, in Section 7.4, we stressed the fact that we don’t actually know the true population parameters. Because we don’t know the true value of \\(\\sigma\\), we have to use an estimate of the population standard deviation \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) instead. This is pretty straightforward to do, but this has the consequence that we need to use the quantiles of the \\(t\\)-distribution rather than the normal distribution to calculate our magic number. And the answer depends on the sample size. When \\(N\\) is very large, we get roughly the same value using \\(t\\)-distribution that we would if we used a normal distribution. But when \\(N\\) is small, we get a much bigger number when we use the \\(t\\) distribution. Table 7.3: 97.5th percentile. Sample size Normal distribution \\(t\\)-distribution \\(N=10000\\) \\(1.959964\\) \\(1.960201\\) \\(N=10\\) \\(1.959964\\) \\(2.262157\\) There’s nothing too mysterious about what’s happening here. Bigger values mean that the confidence interval is wider, indicating that we’re more uncertain about the true value of \\(\\mu\\). When we use the \\(t\\)-distribution instead of the normal distribution, we get bigger numbers, indicating that we have more uncertainty. And why do we have that extra uncertainty? Well, because our estimate of the population standard deviation \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) might be wrong. And if it is wrong, it implies that we are a bit less sure about what our sampling distribution of the mean actually looks like. This uncertainty ends up getting reflected in a wider confidence interval. 7.5.2 Interpreting a confidence interval The hardest thing about confidence intervals is understanding what they mean. Whenever people first encounter confidence intervals, the first instinct is almost always to say that “there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies inside the confidence interval”. It’s simple, and it seems to capture the common sense idea of what it means to say that I am “95% confident”. Unfortunately, it’s not quite right. The intuitive definition relies very heavily on your personal beliefs about the value of the population mean. “I am 95% confident because those are my beliefs.” In everyday life, that’s perfectly okay, but if you remember back to Section 6.2, you’ll notice that talking about personal belief and confidence is a Bayesian idea. Speaking as a Bayesian, there is no problem with the idea that the phrase “95% probability” is allowed to refer to a personal belief. However, confidence intervals are not Bayesian tools. Like everything else in this chapter, confidence intervals are frequentist tools. And if you use frequentist methods, then it’s not appropriate to attach a Bayesian interpretation to them. If you use frequentist methods, you must adopt frequentist interpretations. Figure 7.15: 95% confidence intervals. The top (panel a) shows 50 simulated replications of an experiment in which we measure the IQs of 10 people. The dot marks the location of the sample mean, and the line shows the 95% confidence interval. In total 47 of the 50 confidence intervals do contain the true mean (i.e., 100), but the three intervals marked with asterisks do not. The lower graph (panel b) shows a similar simulation, but this time we simulate replications of an experiment that measures the IQs of 25 people. The critical difference here is that the Bayesian claim makes a probability statement about the population mean (i.e. it refers to our uncertainty about the population mean), which is not allowed under the frequentist interpretation of probability because you can’t “replicate” a population. In the frequentist claim, the population mean is fixed, and no probabilistic claims can be made about it. Confidence intervals, however, are repeatable, so we can replicate experiments. Therefore a frequentist is allowed to talk about the probability that the confidence interval (a random variable) contains the true mean; but is not allowed to talk about the probability that the true population mean (not a repeatable event) falls within the confidence interval. This might seem a little pedantic, but it does matter. It matters because the difference in interpretation leads to a difference in mathematics. There is a Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals, known as credible intervals. In most situations, credible intervals are quite similar to confidence intervals, but in other cases, they are drastically different. We’ll talk more about the Bayesian perspective in Chapter 9. 7.6 Population parameter estimations in CogStat With CogStat, you don’t have to worry about calculating confidence intervals by hand. The program does it for you. In the following example, we’ll use the same data sets as in the previous sections. But this time, we’ll see how CogStat calculates the 95% confidence interval parameters for both the mean and the standard deviation. So, for example, let us load the afl24.Rdata file again and explore the attendance variable with the Explore variable tool. Figure 7.16: Sample properties for attendance CogStat gives you the sample properties as discussed in Chapter 4, but it also gives the population parameter estimations. The estimates for the population mean and standard deviation are calculated automatically at 95% confidence interval level, giving you the low (2.5th percentile) and high (97.5th percentile) values. Figure 7.17: Population parameter estimates for attendance 7.7 Summary In this chapter, we’ve covered two main topics. The first half of the chapter talks about sampling theory, and the second half talks about how we can use sampling theory to construct estimates of the population parameters. The section breakdown looks like this: Basic ideas about samples, sampling and populations (Section 7.1) Statistical theory of sampling: the law of large numbers (Section 7.2), sampling distributions and the central limit theorem (Section 7.3). Estimating means and standard deviations (Section 7.4) Estimating a confidence interval (Section 7.5) As always, there are a lot of topics related to sampling and estimation that aren’t covered in this book, but for an introductory psychology class, this is fairly comprehensive. For most applied researchers, you won’t need much more theory than this. One big question we haven’t discussed in this chapter is what you do when you don’t have a simple random sample. There is a lot of statistical theory you can draw on to handle this situation, but it’s well beyond the scope of this book. The proper mathematical definition of randomness is extraordinarily technical and way beyond the scope of this book. We’ll be non-technical here and say that a process has an element of randomness to it whenever it is possible to repeat it and get different answers each time.↩︎ Nothing in life is that simple: there’s not an obvious division of people into binary categories like “schizophrenic” and “not schizophrenic”. But this isn’t a clinical psychology text, so please forgive a few simplifications here and there.↩︎ Technically, the law of large numbers pertains to any sample statistic that can be described as an average of independent quantities. That’s certainly true for the sample mean. However, it’s also possible to write many other sample statistics as averages of one form or another. The variance of a sample, for instance, can be rewritten as an average and so is subject to the law of large numbers. The minimum value of a sample, however, cannot be written as an average of anything and is therefore not governed by the law of large numbers.↩︎ As usual, we’re being a bit sloppy here. The central limit theorem is a bit more general than this section implies. Like most introductory stats texts, we have discussed one situation where the central limit theorem holds: when you’re taking an average across lots of independent events drawn from the same distribution. However, the central limit theorem is much broader than this. There’s a whole class of things called “\\(U\\)-statistics”, all of which satisfy the central limit theorem and therefore become normally distributed for large sample sizes. The mean is one such statistic, but it’s not the only one.↩︎ Please note that if you were actually interested in this question, you would need to be a lot more careful than we are being here. You can’t simply compare IQ scores in Whyalla to Port Pirie and assume that any differences are due to lead poisoning. Even if it were true that the only differences between the two towns corresponded to the different refineries (and it isn’t, not by a long shot), you need to account for the fact that people already believe that lead pollution causes cognitive deficits: if you recall back to Chapter 3, this means that there are different demand effects for the Port Pirie sample than for the Whyalla sample. In other words, you might end up with an illusory group difference in your data, caused by the fact that people think that there is a real difference. It is pretty implausible to think that the locals wouldn’t be well aware of what you were trying to do if a bunch of researchers turned up in Port Pirie with lab coats and IQ tests, and even less plausible to think that a lot of people would be pretty resentful of you for doing it. Those people won’t be as cooperative in the tests. Other people in Port Pirie might be more motivated to do well because they don’t want their home town to look bad. The motivational effects that would apply in Whyalla are likely to be weaker because people don’t have any concept of “iron ore poisoning” in the same way that they have a concept for “lead poisoning”. Psychology is hard.↩︎ The word cromulent was invented in a Simpsons episode in 1996 and, based on its context, might mean “possible”, “acceptable”, or “fine” according to Merriam-Webster (2022).

It’s now time to turn out attention to the other big idea, which is hypothesis testing. In its most abstract form, hypothesis testing is really a very simple idea: the researcher has some theory about the world and wants to determine whether or not the data actually support that theory. However, the details are messy, and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing to be the most frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the chapter is as follows. Firstly, we’ll talk about how hypothesis testing works in a fair amount of detail, using a simple running example to show you how a hypothesis test is “built”. We’ll focus on the underlying logic of the testing procedure rather than being too dogmatic about it. Afterwards, we’ll spend a bit of time talking about the dogmas, rules and heresies surrounding the hypothesis testing theory. 8.1 A menagerie of hypotheses Eventually, we all succumb to madness. Let’s suppose that this glorious day has come, and we indulge in a most thoroughly unproductive line of psychological research: the search for extrasensory perception (ESP).29 Our first study is a simple one in which we seek to test whether clairvoyance exists. Each participant sits down at a table and is shown a card by an experimenter. The card is black on one side and white on the other. The experimenter takes the card away and places it on a table in an adjacent room. The card is placed black side up or white side up entirely at random, with the randomisation occurring after the experimenter has left the room with the participant. A second experimenter comes in and asks the participant which side of the card is now facing upwards. It’s purely a one-shot experiment. Each person sees only one card and gives only one answer. At no stage is the participant in contact with someone who knows the correct answer. The data set, therefore, is very simple. We have asked the question of, say, \\(N = 100\\) people and \\(X = 62\\) of these people have given the correct response. It’s a surprisingly large number, sure, but is it large enough for us to feel safe in claiming we’ve found evidence for ESP? This is the situation where hypothesis testing comes in useful. However, before we talk about how to test hypotheses, we need to be clear about what we mean by hypotheses. 8.1.1 Research hypotheses versus statistical hypotheses The first distinction that you need to keep clear in your mind is between research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. In our ESP study, the overall scientific goal is to demonstrate that clairvoyance exists. In this situation, we have a clear research goal: we are hoping to discover evidence for ESP. In other cases, we might be a lot more neutral than that, so we might say our goal is to determine whether or not clairvoyance exists. Regardless of how we want to portray it, the basic point that we’re trying to convey here is that a research hypothesis involves making a substantive, testable scientific claim. If you are a psychologist, your research hypotheses are fundamentally about psychological constructs. Any of the following would count as research hypotheses: Listening to music reduces your ability to pay attention to other things. This is a claim about the causal relationship between two psychologically meaningful concepts (listening to music and paying attention to things), so it’s a perfectly reasonable research hypothesis. Intelligence is related to personality. Like the last one, this is a relational claim about two psychological constructs (intelligence and personality), but the claim is weaker: correlational, not causal. Intelligence is* the speed of information processing. This hypothesis has quite a different character: it’s not a relational claim at all. It’s an ontological claim about the fundamental character of intelligence. It’s worth expanding on this one actually: It’s usually easier to think about how to construct experiments to test research hypotheses of the form “does X affect Y?” than it is to address claims like “what is X?” And in practice, what usually happens is that you find ways of testing relational claims that follow from your ontological ones. For instance, if we believe that intelligence is* the speed of information processing in the brain, our experiments will often involve looking for relationships between measures of intelligence and measures of speed. Consequently, most everyday research questions tend to be relational in nature, but they’re almost always motivated by deeper ontological questions about the state of nature. Notice that in practice, our research hypotheses could overlap a lot. The ultimate goal in the ESP experiment might be to test an ontological claim like “ESP exists”. But we might operationally restrict ourselves to a narrower hypothesis like “Some people can ‘see’ objects in a clairvoyant fashion”. That said, some things really don’t count as proper research hypotheses in any meaningful sense: Love is a battlefield. This is too vague to be testable. While it’s okay for a research hypothesis to have a degree of vagueness to it, it has to be possible to operationalise your theoretical ideas. If this cannot be converted into any concrete research design, then this isn’t a scientific research hypothesis: it’s a pop song. The first rule of the tautology club is the first rule of the tautology club. This is not a substantive claim of any kind. It’s true by definition. No conceivable state of nature could possibly be inconsistent with this claim. As such, we say this is an unfalsifiable hypothesis, and as such, it is outside the domain of science. Whatever else you do in science, your claims must have the possibility of being wrong. More people in my experiment will say “yes” than “no”. This one fails as a research hypothesis because it’s a claim about the data set, not about psychology (unless, of course, your actual research question is whether people have some kind of “yes” bias!). As we’ll see shortly, this hypothesis is starting to sound more like a statistical hypothesis than a research hypothesis. As you can see, research hypotheses can be somewhat messy at times; and ultimately, they are scientific claims. Statistical hypotheses are neither of these two things. They must be mathematically precise and correspond to specific claims about the characteristics of the data generating mechanism (i.e. the “population”). Even so, the intent is that statistical hypotheses clearly relate to the substantive research hypotheses you care about! For instance, in our ESP study, the research hypothesis is that some people are able to see through walls or whatever. We want to “map” this onto a statement about how the data were generated. So let’s think about what that statement would be. The quantity that we’d be interested in within the experiment is \\(P(\\mbox{&quot;correct&quot;})\\), the true-but-unknown probability with which the participants in my experiment answer the question correctly. Let’s use the Greek letter \\(\\theta\\) (theta) to refer to this probability. Here are four different statistical hypotheses: If ESP doesn’t exist and if the experiment is well designed, then the participants are just guessing. So we should expect them to get it right half of the time, and so the statistical hypothesis is that the true probability of choosing correctly is \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). Alternatively, suppose ESP does exist, and participants can see the card. If that’s true, people will perform better than chance. The statistical hypothesis would be that \\(\\theta &gt; 0.5\\). A third possibility is that ESP does exist, but the colours are all reversed, and people don’t realise it. If that’s how it works, then you’d expect people’s performance to be below chance. This would correspond to a statistical hypothesis that \\(\\theta &lt; 0.5\\). Finally, suppose ESP exists, but we have no idea whether people are seeing the right colour or the wrong one. In that case, the only claim to be made about the data would be that the probability of making the correct answer is not equal to 50. This corresponds to the statistical hypothesis that \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\). These are legitimate examples of statistical hypotheses because they are statements about a population parameter and are meaningfully related to my experiment. What this discussion hopefully makes clear is that when attempting to construct a statistical hypothesis test, the researcher has two quite distinct hypotheses to consider. They have a research hypothesis (a claim about psychology) corresponding to a statistical hypothesis (a claim about the data generating population). Table 8.1: Research and statistical hypotheses in our ESP research example. Research hypothesis Statistical hypothesis ESP exists \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\) And the critical thing to recognise is this: a statistical hypothesis test is a test of the statistical hypothesis, not the research hypothesis. If your study is poorly designed, the link between your research hypothesis and your statistical hypothesis is broken. To give a silly example, suppose that the ESP study was conducted in a situation where the participant can actually see the card reflected in a window; if that happens, we would be able to find robust evidence that \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\), but this would tell us nothing about whether “ESP exists”. 8.1.2 Null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses So far, so good. We have a research hypothesis that corresponds to what we want to believe about the world, and we can map it onto a statistical hypothesis that corresponds to what we want to believe about how the data were generated. It’s at this point that things get somewhat counterintuitive for a lot of people. Because what we’re about to do is invent a new statistical hypothesis (the “null” hypothesis, \\(H_0\\)) that corresponds to the exact opposite of what we want to believe and then focus exclusively on that, almost to the neglect of the thing we’re actually interested in (which is now called the “alternative” hypothesis, \\(H_1\\)). In our ESP example, the null hypothesis is that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\), since that’s what we’d expect if ESP didn’t exist. The hope, of course, is that ESP is totally real, and so the alternative to this null hypothesis is \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\). In essence, what we’re doing here is dividing up the possible values of \\(\\theta\\) into two groups: those values that we really hope aren’t true (the null) and those values that we’d be happy with if they turn out to be correct (the alternative). Having done so, the important thing to recognise is that the goal of a hypothesis test is not to show that the alternative hypothesis is (probably) true; the goal is to show that the null hypothesis is (probably) false. Most people find this pretty weird. According to Danielle, the best way to think about it is to imagine that a hypothesis test is a criminal trial: the trial of the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the defendant, the researcher is the prosecutor, and the statistical test itself is the judge. Just like a criminal trial, there is a presumption of innocence: the null hypothesis is deemed to be true unless you, the researcher, can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is false. You are free to design your experiment however you like (within reason, obviously!), and your goal when doing so is to maximise the chance that the data will yield a conviction for the crime of being false. The catch is that the statistical test sets the rules of the trial, which are designed to protect the null hypothesis – specifically to ensure that if the null hypothesis is true, the chances of a false conviction are guaranteed to be low. This is pretty important: after all, the null hypothesis doesn’t get a lawyer. And given that the researcher is trying desperately to prove it to be false, someone has to protect it. 8.2 Two types of errors Ideally, we would like to construct our test so that we never make any errors. Unfortunately, this is never possible. Sometimes you’re just really unlucky: for instance, suppose you flip a coin 10 times in a row and it comes up heads all 10 times. That feels like powerful evidence that the coin is biased (and it is!), but of course, there’s a 1 in 1024 chance that this would happen even if the coin was totally fair. In other words, in real life, we always have to accept that there’s a chance that we did the wrong thing. Consequently, statistical hypothesis testing aims not to eliminate errors but to minimise them. At this point, we need to be more precise about what we mean by “errors”. Firstly, let’s state the obvious: it is either the case that the null hypothesis is true, or it is false. And our test will either reject the null hypothesis or retain it. So, as the table below illustrates, after we run the test and make our choice, one of four things might have happened: Retain \\(H_0\\) Reject \\(H_0\\) \\(H_0\\) is true Correct decision Error (type I) \\(H_0\\) is false Error (type II) Correct decision As a consequence, there are actually two different types of error here. If we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true, then we have made a type I error. On the other hand, if we retain the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, false, then we have made a type II error. A criminal trial requires that you establish “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the defendant did it. The trial is designed to protect the rights of a defendant. In other words, a criminal trial doesn’t treat the two types of error in the same way: punishing the innocent is deemed to be much worse than letting the guilty go free. A statistical test is pretty much the same: the single most important design principle of the test is to control the probability of a type I error to keep it below some fixed probability. This probability, which is denoted \\(\\alpha\\), is called the significance level of the test (or sometimes, the size of the test). A hypothesis test is said to have a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) if the type I error rate is no larger than \\(\\alpha\\). So, what about the type II error rate? Well, we’d also like to keep those under control too, and we denote this probability by \\(\\beta\\). However, it’s much more common to refer to the power of the test, which is the probability with which we reject a null hypothesis when it is false, which is \\(1-\\beta\\). To help keep this straight, here’s the same table again, but with the relevant numbers added: Retain \\(H_0\\) Reject \\(H_0\\) \\(H_0\\) is true \\(1-\\alpha\\) (probability of correct retention) \\(\\alpha\\) (type I error rate) \\(H_0\\) is false \\(\\beta\\) (type II error rate) \\(1-\\beta\\) (power of the test) A “powerful” hypothesis test has a small value of \\(\\beta\\) while still keeping \\(\\alpha\\) fixed at some (small) desired level. By convention, scientists make use of three different \\(\\alpha\\) levels: \\(.05\\), \\(.01\\) and \\(.001\\). Notice the asymmetry here: the tests are designed to ensure that the \\(\\alpha\\) level is kept small, but there’s no corresponding guarantee regarding \\(\\beta\\). We’d certainly like the type II error rate to be small, and we try to design tests that keep it small, but this is very much secondary to the overwhelming need to control the type I error rate. Paraphrasing Blackstone had he been a statistician: it is “better to retain ten false null hypotheses than to reject a single true one”. However, there are situations where it might not make sense – but that’s neither here nor there. It’s how the tests are built. 8.3 Test statistics and sampling distributions At this point, we need to start talking specifics about how to construct a hypothesis test. To that end, let’s return to the ESP example. Let’s ignore the actual data we obtained, for the moment, and think about the structure of the experiment. Regardless of the actual numbers, the form of the data is that \\(X\\) out of \\(N\\) people correctly identified the colour of the hidden card. Moreover, let’s suppose for the moment that the null hypothesis really is true: ESP doesn’t exist, and the true probability that anyone picks the correct colour is exactly \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). What would we expect the data to look like? Well, obviously, we’d expect the proportion of people who make the correct response to be pretty close to 50%. Or, to phrase this in more mathematical terms, we’d say that \\(X/N\\) is approximately \\(0.5\\). Of course, we wouldn’t expect this fraction to be exactly 0.5: if, for example, we tested \\(N=100\\) people, and \\(X = 53\\) of them got the question right, we’d probably be forced to concede that the data are quite consistent with the null hypothesis. On the other hand, if \\(X = 99\\) of our participants got the question right, then we’d feel pretty confident that the null hypothesis is wrong. Similarly, if only \\(X=3\\) people got the answer right, we’d be similarly confident that the null was wrong. Let’s be a little more technical about this: we have a quantity \\(X\\) that we can calculate by looking at our data; after looking at the value of \\(X\\), we decide whether to believe that the null hypothesis is correct or to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The name for this thing that we calculate to guide our choices is a test statistic. Having chosen a test statistic, now the next step is to state precisely which values of the test statistic would cause us to reject the null hypothesis and which values would cause us to keep it. To do so, we need to determine what the sampling distribution of the test statistic would be if the null hypothesis were true (we discussed sampling distributions earlier in Section 7.3.1). Why do we need this? Because this distribution tells us precisely what values of \\(X\\), our null hypothesis would lead us to expect. And therefore, we can use this distribution to assess how closely the null hypothesis agrees with our data. Figure 8.1: The sampling distribution for our test statistic \\(X\\) when the null hypothesis is true. For our ESP scenario, this is a binomial distribution. Not surprisingly, since the null hypothesis says that the probability of a correct response is \\(\\theta = .5\\), the sampling distribution says that the most likely value is 50 (out of 100) correct responses. Most of the probability mass lies between 40 and 60. How do we determine the sampling distribution of the test statistic? Fortunately, our ESP example provides us with one of the most uncomplicated cases. Our population parameter \\(\\theta\\) is just the overall probability that people respond correctly when asked the question, and our test statistic \\(X\\) is the count of the number of people who did so out of a sample size of \\(N\\). We’ve seen a distribution like this in Section 6.4.1: that’s exactly what the binomial distribution describes! So, to use the notation and terminology introduced in that section, we would say that the null hypothesis predicts that \\(X\\) is binomially distributed, which is written \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(\\theta,N) \\] Since the null hypothesis states that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\) and our experiment has \\(N=100\\) people, we have the sampling distribution we need. This sampling distribution is plotted in Figure 8.1. No surprises, really: the null hypothesis says that \\(X=50\\) is the most likely outcome, and it says that we’re almost certain to see somewhere between 40 and 60 correct responses. 8.4 Making decisions We’ve constructed a test statistic (\\(X\\)), and we chose it so that we’re pretty confident that if \\(X\\) is close to \\(N/2\\), then we should retain the null, and if not, we should reject it. The question remains: exactly which values of the test statistic should we associate with the null hypothesis, and which values go with the alternative hypothesis? In the ESP study, for example, we’ve observed a value of \\(X=62\\). What decision should we make? Should we choose to believe the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis? 8.4.1 Critical regions and critical values To answer this question, we need to introduce the concept of a critical region for the test statistic \\(X\\). The critical region of the test corresponds to those values of \\(X\\) that would lead us to reject the null hypothesis (which is why the critical region is also sometimes called the rejection region). How do we find this critical region? Well, let’s consider what we know: \\(X\\) should be very big or very small to reject the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of \\(X\\) is Binomial\\((0.5, N)\\). If \\(\\alpha =.05\\), the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution. You must understand this last point: the critical region corresponds to those values of \\(X\\) for which we would reject the null hypothesis, and the sampling distribution in question describes the probability that we would obtain a particular value of \\(X\\) if the null hypothesis were actually true. Now, let’s suppose that we chose a critical region that covers 20% of the sampling distribution, and assume that the null hypothesis is actually true. What would be the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null? The answer is, of course, 20%. And therefore, we would have built a test that had an \\(\\alpha\\) level of \\(0.2\\). If we want \\(\\alpha = .05\\), the critical region is only allowed to cover 5% of the sampling distribution of our test statistic. Figure 8.2: The critical region associated with the hypothesis test for the ESP study, for a hypothesis test with a significance level of \\(\\alpha = .05\\). The plot shows the sampling distribution of \\(X\\) under the null hypothesis: the grey bars correspond to those values of \\(X\\), for which we would retain the null hypothesis. The black bars show the critical region: those values of \\(X\\) for which we would reject the null. Because the alternative hypothesis is two-sided (i.e. allows both \\(\\theta &lt;.5\\) and \\(\\theta &gt;.5\\)), the critical region covers both tails of the distribution. To ensure an \\(\\alpha\\) level of \\(.05\\), we need to ensure that each of the two regions encompasses 2.5% of the sampling distribution. As it turns out, those three things uniquely solve the problem: our critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the tails of the distribution (illustrated in Figure 8.2). As it turns out, if we want \\(\\alpha = .05\\), then our critical regions correspond to \\(X \\leq 40\\) and \\(X \\geq 60\\).30 If the number of people saying “true” is between 41 and 59, we should retain the null hypothesis. We should reject the null hypothesis if the number is between 0 to 40 or between 60 to 100. The numbers 40 and 60 are often referred to as the critical values since they define the edges of the critical region. At this point, our hypothesis test is essentially complete: - (1) we choose an \\(\\alpha\\) level (e.g. \\(\\alpha = .05\\)), - (2) we come up with some test statistic (e.g., \\(X\\)) that does a good job (in some meaningful sense) of comparing \\(H_0\\) to \\(H_1\\), - (3) we figure out the sampling distribution of the test statistic on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (in this case, binomial) and then - (4) we calculate the critical region that produces an appropriate \\(\\alpha\\) level (0-40 and 60-100). Now, we have to calculate the value of the test statistic for the real data (e.g., \\(X = 62\\)) and then compare it to the critical values to make our decision. Since 62 is greater than the critical value of 60, we would reject the null hypothesis. Or, to phrase it slightly differently, we say that the test has produced a significant result. 8.4.2 A note on statistical “significance” A very brief digression is in order regarding the word “significant”. It is a misnomer. The concept of statistical significance is very simple, but has a very unfortunate name. If the data allows us to reject the null hypothesis, we say that “the result is statistically significant”, often shortened to “the result is significant”. This terminology dates back to a time when “significant” just meant something like “indicated” rather than its modern meaning, which is much closer to “important”. As a result, many modern readers get very confused when they start learning statistics because they think a “significant result” must be an important one. It doesn’t mean that at all. All that “statistically significant” means is that the data allowed us to reject a null hypothesis. Whether or not the result is actually important in the real world is a very different question and depends on all sorts of other things. 8.4.3 A note on the word “prove” An aside regarding the language you use to talk about hypothesis testing. Firstly, one thing you really want to avoid is the word “prove”: a statistical test really doesn’t prove that a hypothesis is true or false. Proof implies certainty, and as the saying goes, statistics means never having to say you’re certain. On that point, almost everyone would agree. However, beyond that, there’s a fair amount of confusion. Some people argue that you’re only allowed to make statements like “rejected the null”, “failed to reject the null”, or possibly “retained the null”. According to this line of thinking, you can’t say things like “accept the alternative” or “accept the null”. Personally I think this is too strong: in my opinion, this conflates null hypothesis testing with Karl Popper’s falsificationist view of the scientific process. While there are similarities between falsificationism and null hypothesis testing, they aren’t equivalent. However, while I personally think it’s fine to talk about accepting a hypothesis (on the proviso that “acceptance” doesn’t actually mean that it’s necessarily true, especially in the case of the null hypothesis), many people will disagree. And more to the point, you should be aware that this particular weirdness exists so that you’re not caught unawares by it when writing up your own results. – Danielle 8.4.4 The difference between one sided and two sided tests There’s one more thing to point out about the constructed hypothesis test. Let us take a moment to think about the statistical hypotheses: \\[ \\begin{array}{cc} H_0 : &amp; \\theta = .5 \\\\ H_1 : &amp; \\theta \\neq .5 \\end{array} \\] We notice that the alternative hypothesis covers both the possibility that \\(\\theta &lt; .5\\) and the possibility that \\(\\theta &gt; .5\\). This makes sense if we think ESP could produce better-than-chance performance or worse-than-chance performance. This is an example of a two-sided test in statistical language. It’s called this because the alternative hypothesis covers the area on both “sides” of the null hypothesis. As a consequence, the critical region of the test covers both tails of the sampling distribution (2.5% on either side provided that \\(\\alpha =.05\\)), as illustrated earlier in Figure 8.2. However, that’s not the only possibility. For example, it might be the case that we’re only willing to believe in ESP if it produces better than chance performance. If so, then the alternative hypothesis would only cover the possibility that \\(\\theta &gt; .5\\), and as a consequence, the null hypothesis now becomes \\(\\theta \\leq .5\\): \\[ \\begin{array}{cc} H_0 : &amp; \\theta \\leq .5 \\\\ H_1 : &amp; \\theta &gt; .5 \\end{array} \\] When this happens, we have what’s called a one-sided test, and when this happens, the critical region only covers one tail of the sampling distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.3: The critical region for a one sided test. In this case, the alternative hypothesis is that \\(\\theta &gt; .05\\), so we would only reject the null hypothesis for large values of \\(X\\). As a consequence, the critical region only covers the upper tail of the sampling distribution; specifically the upper 5% of the distribution. Contrast this to the two-sided version earlier) 8.5 The \\(p\\) value of a test In one sense, our hypothesis test is complete; we’ve constructed a test statistic, figured out its sampling distribution if the null hypothesis is true, and then constructed the critical region for the test. Nevertheless, we’ve actually omitted the most important number of all: the \\(p\\) value. It is to this topic that we now turn. There are two somewhat different ways of interpreting a \\(p\\) value, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other by Jerzy Neyman. Both versions are legitimate, though they reflect very different ways of thinking about hypothesis tests. Most introductory textbooks only give Fisher’s version, but that’s a bit of a shame. Danielle is believes Neyman’s version is cleaner and that it better reflects the logic of the null hypothesis test. You might disagree, though, so both are included. We’ll start with Neyman’s version. 8.5.1 A softer view of decision making One problem with the hypothesis testing procedure is that it makes no distinction between a “barely significant” and a “highly significant” result. For instance, in the ESP study, the data only just fell inside the critical region - so we did get a significant effect, but it was a pretty near thing. In contrast, suppose we run a study in which \\(X=97\\) out of the \\(N=100\\) participants got the answer right. This would obviously be significant, too, but by a much larger margin. There is no real ambiguity about this at all. The procedure makes no distinction between the two. If we adopt the standard convention of allowing \\(\\alpha = .05\\) as an acceptable Type I error rate, then both are significant results. This is where the \\(p\\) value comes in handy. To understand how it works, let’s suppose that we ran many hypothesis tests on the same data set: but with a different value of \\(\\alpha\\) in each case. When we do that for our ESP data, what we’d get is something like this: Value of \\(\\alpha\\) Reject the null? 0.05 Yes 0.04 Yes 0.03 Yes 0.02 No 0.01 No When we test ESP data (\\(X=62\\) successes out of \\(N=100\\) observations) using \\(\\alpha\\) levels of .03 and above, we always reject the null hypothesis. We always retain the null hypothesis for \\(\\alpha\\) levels of .02 and below. Therefore, somewhere between .02 and .03, there must be the smallest value of \\(\\alpha\\) that would allow us to reject the null hypothesis for this data. This is the \\(p\\) value; as it turns out the ESP data has \\(p = .021\\). In short: \\(p\\) is defined to be the smallest Type I error rate (\\(\\alpha\\)) that you have to be willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis. If it turns out that \\(p\\) describes an error rate that you find intolerable, then you must retain the null. If you’re comfortable with an error rate equal to \\(p\\), then it’s okay to reject the null hypothesis in favour of your preferred alternative. In effect, \\(p\\) is a summary of all the possible hypothesis tests you could have run, taken across all possible \\(\\alpha\\) values. And as a consequence, it has the effect of “softening” our decision process. For those tests in which \\(p \\leq \\alpha\\), you would have rejected the null hypothesis, whereas for those tests in which \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\), you would have retained the null. In our ESP study, we obtained \\(X=62\\), and as a consequence we’ve ended up with \\(p = .021\\). So the error rate we have to tolerate is 2.1%. In contrast, suppose the experiment had yielded \\(X=97\\). What happens to the \\(p\\) value now? This time it’s shrunk to \\(p = 1.36 \\times 10^{-25}\\), which is a tiny, tiny31 Type I error rate. For this second case, we would be able to reject the null hypothesis with a lot more confidence because we only have to be “willing” to tolerate a type I error rate of about 1 in 10 trillion trillion to justify our decision to reject. 8.5.2 The probability of extreme data The second definition of the \\(p\\)-value comes from Sir Ronald Fisher, which you tend to see in most introductory statistics textbooks. Notice how, when we constructed the critical region, it corresponded to the tails (i.e. extreme values) of the sampling distribution? That’s not a coincidence: almost all “good” tests have this characteristic (good in minimising our type II error rate, \\(\\beta\\)). The reason for that is that a good critical region almost always corresponds to those values of the test statistic that are least likely to be observed if the null hypothesis is true. If this rule is true, then we can define the \\(p\\)-value as the probability that we would have observed a test statistic that is at least as extreme as the one we actually did get. In other words, if the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong. 8.5.3 A common mistake You can see that there are two somewhat different but legitimate ways to interpret the \\(p\\) value, one based on Neyman’s approach to hypothesis testing and the other based on Fisher’s. Unfortunately, there is a third explanation that people sometimes give, especially when they’re first learning statistics, and it is absolutely and completely wrong. This mistaken approach is to refer to the \\(p\\) value as “the probability that the null hypothesis is true”. It’s an intuitively appealing way to think, but it’s wrong in two key respects: null hypothesis testing is a frequentist tool, and the frequentist approach to probability does not allow you to assign probabilities to the null hypothesis. According to this view of probability, the null hypothesis is either true or not, but it cannot have a “5% chance” of being true. even within the Bayesian approach, which does let you assign probabilities to hypotheses, the \\(p\\) value would not correspond to the probability that the null is true; this interpretation is entirely inconsistent with the mathematics of how the \\(p\\) value is calculated. Put bluntly, despite the intuitive appeal of thinking this way, there is no justification for interpreting a \\(p\\) value this way. Never do it. 8.6 Reporting the results of a hypothesis test When writing up the results of a hypothesis test, there are usually several pieces of information that you need to report, but it varies a fair bit from test to test. In the chapters discussing each statistical tool, we’ll spend a little time talking about how to report the results correctly. However, regardless of what test you’re doing, the one thing that you always have to do is say something about the \\(p\\) value and whether or not the outcome was significant. The fact that you have to do this is unsurprising: it’s the whole point of doing the test. It might be surprising, though, that there is some contention over exactly how you’re supposed to do it. Leaving aside those people who completely disagree with the entire framework underpinning null hypothesis testing, there’s a certain amount of tension that exists regarding whether or not to report the exact \\(p\\) value that you obtained, or if you should state only that \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) for a significance level that you chose in advance (e.g., \\(p&lt;.05\\)). 8.6.1 The issue To see why this is an issue, the key thing to recognise is that \\(p\\) values are terribly convenient. In practice, the fact that we can compute a \\(p\\) value means that we don’t have to specify any \\(\\alpha\\) level at all to run the test. Instead, what you can do is calculate your \\(p\\) value and interpret it directly: if you get \\(p = .062\\), then it means that you’d have to be willing to tolerate a Type I error rate of 6.2% to justify rejecting the null. If you personally find 6.2% intolerable, then you retain the null. Therefore, the argument goes, why don’t we just report the actual \\(p\\) value and let the reader make up their own minds about what an acceptable Type I error rate is? This approach has the big advantage of “softening” the decision-making process – in fact, if you accept the Neyman definition of the \\(p\\) value, that’s the whole point of the \\(p\\) value. We no longer have a fixed significance level of \\(\\alpha = .05\\) as a bright line separating “accept” from “reject” decisions; and this removes the rather pathological problem of being forced to treat \\(p = .051\\) in a fundamentally different way to \\(p = .049\\). This flexibility is both the advantage and the disadvantage to the \\(p\\) value. Many people don’t like the idea of reporting an exact \\(p\\) value because it gives the researcher a bit too much freedom. In particular, it lets you change your mind about what error tolerance you’re willing to put up with after you look at the data. For instance, consider the ESP experiment. Suppose we ran the test and ended up with a \\(p\\) value of .09. Should we accept or reject? Now, we haven’t yet bothered to think about what level of Type I error we’re “really” willing to accept. But we do have an opinion about whether or not ESP exists. Regardless, we could always decide that a 9% error rate isn’t so bad, especially compared to how annoying it would be to admit to the world that the experiment has failed. So, to avoid looking like we just made it up after the fact, we now say that our \\(\\alpha\\) is .1: a 10% type I error rate isn’t too bad, and at that level, our test is significant! We win. In other words, the worry here is that we might have the best of intentions and be the most honest of people, but the temptation to just “shade” things a little bit here and there is really, really strong. Anyone who has ever run an experiment can attest that it’s a long and difficult process, and you often get very attached to your hypotheses. It’s hard to let go and admit the experiment didn’t find what you wanted it to find. And that’s the danger here. If we use the “raw” \\(p\\)-value, people will start interpreting the data in terms of what they want to believe, not what the data are actually saying. And if we allow that, well, why are we bothering to do science at all? Why not let everyone believe whatever they like about anything, regardless of what the facts are? Okay, that’s a bit extreme, but that’s where the worry comes from. According to this view, you really must specify your \\(\\alpha\\) value in advance and then only report whether the test was significant or not. It’s the only way to keep ourselves honest. 8.6.2 Two proposed solutions In practice, it’s pretty rare for a researcher to specify a single \\(\\alpha\\) level ahead of time. Instead, the convention is that scientists rely on three standard significance levels: .05, .01 and .001. When reporting your results, you indicate which (if any) of these significance levels allow you to reject the null hypothesis. This is summarised in Table 8.2. This allows us to soften the decision rule a little bit since \\(p&lt;.01\\) implies that the data meet a stronger evidentiary standard than \\(p&lt;.05\\) would. Nevertheless, since these levels are fixed in advance by convention, it does prevent people from choosing their \\(\\alpha\\) level after looking at the data. Table 8.2: A commonly adopted convention for reporting \\(p\\) values: in many places it is conventional to report one of four different things (e.g., \\(p&lt;.05\\)) as shown below. A “significance stars” notation (i.e., a * indicates \\(p&lt;.05\\)) is sometimes produced by statistical software. It’s also worth noting that some people will write n.s. (not significant) rather than \\(p&gt;.05\\). Usual notation Signif. stars Meaning The null is… \\(p&gt;.05\\) The test wasn’t significant Retained \\(p&lt;.05\\) * The test was significant at $= .05 but not at \\(\\alpha =.01\\) or \\(\\alpha = .001\\).$ Rejected \\(p&lt;.01\\) ** The test was significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\) and \\(\\alpha = .01\\) but not at $= .001 Rejected \\(p&lt;.001\\) *** The test was significant at all levels Rejected Nevertheless, many people still prefer to report exact \\(p\\) values. To many people, the advantage of allowing the reader to make up their own mind about how to interpret \\(p = .06\\) outweighs any disadvantages. In practice, however, even among those researchers who prefer exact \\(p\\) values, it is quite common to just write \\(p&lt;.001\\) instead of reporting an exact value for small \\(p\\). This is in part because a lot of software doesn’t actually print out the \\(p\\) value when it’s that small (e.g., SPSS just writes \\(p = .000\\) whenever \\(p&lt;.001\\)), and in part because a very small \\(p\\) value can be kind of misleading. The human mind sees a number like .0000000001, and it’s hard to suppress the gut feeling that the evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis is a near certainty. In practice, however, this is usually wrong. Every statistical test ever invented relies on simplifications, approximations and assumptions. As a consequence, it’s probably not reasonable to walk away from any statistical analysis with a feeling of confidence stronger than \\(p&lt;.001\\) implies. In other words, \\(p&lt;.001\\) is really code for “as far as this test is concerned, the evidence is overwhelming.” In light of all this, you might wonder what exactly you should do. There’s a fair bit of contradictory advice on the topic, with some people arguing that you should report the exact \\(p\\) value and other people arguing that you should use the tiered approach illustrated in Table 8.2. As a result, the best advice is that you look at papers/reports written in your field and see what the convention seems to be. If there doesn’t seem to be any consistent pattern, then use whichever method you prefer. For any hypothesis test that CogStat will run for you, whether that be a t-test, ANOVA, regression, etc., the output will include a \\(p\\) value. If you want to report the \\(p\\) value, you can just copy and paste it from the output. 8.7 Effect size, sample size and power In previous sections, we emphasised the fact that the major design principle behind statistical hypothesis testing is that we try to control our Type I error rate. When we fix \\(\\alpha = .05\\), we are attempting to ensure that only 5% of true null hypotheses are incorrectly rejected. However, this doesn’t mean that we don’t care about Type II errors. In fact, from the researcher’s perspective, the error of failing to reject the null when it is actually false is an extremely annoying one. With that in mind, a secondary goal of hypothesis testing is to try to minimise \\(\\beta\\), the Type II error rate, although we don’t usually talk in terms of minimising Type II errors. Instead, we talk about maximising the power of the test. Since power is defined as \\(1-\\beta\\), this is the same thing. 8.7.1 The power function Figure 8.4: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis, for a population parameter value of \\(\\theta = 0.55\\). A reasonable proportion of the distribution lies in the rejection region. Let’s take a moment to think about what a Type II error actually is. A Type II error occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true, but we are nevertheless unable to reject the null hypothesis. Ideally, we’d be able to calculate a single number \\(\\beta\\) that tells us the Type II error rate, similarly to how we can set \\(\\alpha = .05\\) for the Type I error rate. Unfortunately, this is a lot trickier to do. To see this, notice that in the ESP study, the alternative hypothesis actually corresponds to lots of possible values of \\(\\theta\\). In fact, the alternative hypothesis corresponds to every value of \\(\\theta\\) except 0.5. Let’s suppose that the true probability of someone choosing the correct response is 55% (i.e., \\(\\theta = .55\\)). If so, then the true sampling distribution for \\(X\\) is not the same one that the null hypothesis predicts: the most likely value for \\(X\\) is now 55 out of 100. Not only that, the whole sampling distribution has now shifted, as shown in Figure 8.4. The critical regions, of course, do not change: by definition, the critical regions are based on what the null hypothesis predicts. What we’re seeing in this figure is the fact that when the null hypothesis is wrong, a much larger proportion of the sampling distribution falls in the critical region. And, of course, that’s what should happen: the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is larger when the null hypothesis is actually false! However, \\(\\theta = .55\\) is not the only possibility that is consistent with the alternative hypothesis. Let’s instead suppose that the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is 0.7. What happens to the sampling distribution when this occurs? The answer, shown in Figure 8.5, is that almost the entirety of the sampling distribution has now moved into the critical region. Therefore, if \\(\\theta = 0.7\\), the probability of us correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. the power of the test) is much larger than if \\(\\theta = 0.55\\). In short, while \\(\\theta = .55\\) and \\(\\theta = .70\\) are both part of the alternative hypothesis, the Type II error rate is different. Figure 8.5: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis, for a population parameter value of \\(\\theta = 0.70\\). Almost all of the distribution lies in the rejection region. Figure 8.6: The probability that we will reject the null hypothesis is plotted as a function of the true value of \\(\\theta\\). Obviously, the test is more powerful (greater chance of correct rejection) if the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is very different from the value that the null hypothesis specifies (i.e., \\(\\theta=.5\\)). Notice that when \\(\\theta\\) actually is equal to .5 (plotted as a black dot), the null hypothesis is, in fact, true: rejecting the null hypothesis in this instance would be a Type I error. This means that the power of a test (i.e., \\(1-\\beta\\)) depends on the true value of \\(\\theta\\). To illustrate this, we’ve calculated the expected probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for all values of \\(\\theta\\) and plotted it in Figure 8.6. This plot describes what is usually called the power function of the test. It’s a nice summary of how good the test is because it actually tells you the power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) for all possible values of \\(\\theta\\). As you can see, when the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is very close to 0.5, the power of the test drops very sharply, but when it is further away, the power is large. 8.7.2 Effect size The plot shown in Figure 8.6 captures a basic point about hypothesis testing. If the true state of the world is very different from what the null hypothesis predicts, then your power will be very high; but if the true state of the world is similar to the null (but not identical), then the power of the test is going to be very low. Therefore, it’s useful to be able to have some way of quantifying how “similar” the true state of the world is to the null hypothesis. A statistic that does this is called a measure of effect size (e.g. Cohen, 1988; Ellis, 2010). Effect size is defined slightly differently in different contexts, but the qualitative idea that it tries to capture is always the same: how big is the difference between the true population parameters and the parameter values that are assumed by the null hypothesis. In our ESP example, if we let \\(\\theta_0 = 0.5\\) denote the value assumed by the null hypothesis, and let \\(\\theta\\) denote the true value, then a simple measure of effect size could be something like the difference between the true value and null (i.e., \\(\\theta - \\theta_0\\)), or possibly just the magnitude of this difference, \\(\\mbox{abs}(\\theta - \\theta_0)\\). Big effect size Small effect size Significant result difference is real, and of practical importance difference is real, but might not be interesting Non-significant result no effect observed no effect observed Why calculate effect size? Let’s assume that you’ve run your experiment, collected the data, and gotten a significant effect when you ran your hypothesis test. Isn’t it enough just to say that you’ve gotten a significant effect? Surely that’s the point of hypothesis testing? Well, sort of. Yes, the point of doing a hypothesis test is to try to demonstrate that the null hypothesis is wrong, but that’s hardly the only thing we’re interested in. If the null hypothesis claimed that \\(\\theta = .5\\), and we show that it’s wrong, we’ve only really told half of the story. Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that we believe that \\(\\theta \\neq .5\\), but there’s a big difference between \\(\\theta = .51\\) and \\(\\theta = .8\\). If we find that \\(\\theta = .8\\), then not only have we found that the null hypothesis is wrong, it appears to be very wrong. On the other hand, suppose we’ve successfully rejected the null hypothesis, but it looks like the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is only .51 (this would only be possible with a large study). Sure, the null hypothesis is wrong, but it’s not at all clear that we actually care, because the effect size is so small. In the context of the ESP study, we might still care, since any demonstration of real psychic powers would actually be pretty cool32, but in other contexts, a 1% difference isn’t very interesting, even if it is a real difference. For instance, suppose we’re looking at differences in high school exam scores between males and females, and it turns out that the female scores are 1% higher on average than the males. If I’ve got data from thousands of students, then this difference will almost certainly be statistically significant, but regardless of how small the \\(p\\) value is, it’s just not very interesting. You’d hardly want to go around proclaiming a crisis in boys’ education based on such a tiny difference, would you? For this reason, it is becoming more standard (slowly but surely) to report some kind of standard measure of effect size along with the results of the hypothesis test. The hypothesis test itself tells you whether you should believe that the effect you have observed is real (i.e., not just due to chance); the effect size tells you whether or not you should care. 8.7.3 Increasing the power of your study Not surprisingly, scientists are fairly obsessed with maximising the power of their experiments. We want our experiments to work, so we want to maximise the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false (and we usually want to believe it is false!). As we’ve seen, one factor that influences power is the effect size. So the first thing you can do to increase your power is to increase the effect size. In practice, this means that you want to design your study so that the effect size gets magnified. For instance, in the ESP study, we might believe that psychic powers work best in a quiet, darkened room; with fewer distractions to cloud the mind. Therefore, we would try to conduct the experiments in such an environment. If we can strengthen people’s ESP abilities somehow, then the true value of \\(\\theta\\) will go up33 and, therefore, our effect size will be larger. In short, clever experimental design is one way to boost power; because it can alter the effect size. Unfortunately, it’s often the case that even with the best experimental designs, you may have only a small effect. Perhaps, for example, ESP really does exist, but even under the best of conditions, it’s very very weak. Under those circumstances, your best bet for increasing power is to increase the sample size. Generally, the more observations you have available, the more likely you can discriminate between two hypotheses. If we had 10 participants, and 7 of them correctly guessed the colour of the hidden card, you wouldn’t be terribly impressed. But if we had 10,000 participants and 7,000 of them got the answer right, you would likely think we had discovered something. In other words, power increases with the sample size. This is illustrated in Figure 8.7, which shows the power of the test for a true parameter of \\(\\theta = 0.7\\), for all sample sizes \\(N\\) from 1 to 100, where I’m assuming that the null hypothesis predicts that \\(\\theta_0 = 0.5\\). Figure 8.7: The power of our test, plotted as a function of the sample size \\(N\\). In this case, the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is 0.7, but the null hypothesis is that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). Overall, larger \\(N\\) means greater power. (The small zig-zags in this function occur because of some odd interactions between \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\alpha\\) and the fact that the binomial distribution is discrete; it doesn’t matter for any serious purpose) Because power is important, it would be pretty useful to know how much power you’re likely to have when you’re contemplating running an experiment. It’s never possible to know for sure since you can’t possibly know what your effect size is. However, it’s sometimes possible to guess how big it should be. If so, you can guess what sample size you need! This idea is called power analysis. If it’s feasible to do it, it’s very helpful since it can tell you whether you have enough time or money to run the experiment successfully. It’s increasingly common to see people arguing that power analysis should be a required part of experimental design, so it’s worth knowing about, but we won’t be discussing it in this book. As per Danielle’s observations, the only time any scientist ever seems to want a power analysis in real life is when they’re being forced to do it by a bureaucratic process. It’s not part of anyone’s day-to-day work. In short, while power is an important concept, power analysis is not as useful as people make it sound, except in the rare cases where (a) someone has figured out how to calculate power for your actual experimental design and (b) you have a pretty good idea what the effect size is likely to be. 8.8 Some issues to consider What we’ve discussed in this chapter is the orthodox framework for null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Understanding how NHST works is an absolute necessity since it has been the dominant approach to inferential statistics since its prominence in the early 20th century. It’s what the vast majority of working scientists rely on for their data analysis, so even if you hate it, you need to know it. However, the approach is not without problems. There are several quirks in the framework, historical oddities in how it came to be, theoretical disputes over whether or not the framework is proper, and many practical traps for the unwary. Without going into much detail on this topic, it’s worth briefly discussing a few of these issues. 8.8.1 Neyman versus Fisher The first thing you should be aware of is that orthodox NHST is a mash-up of two somewhat different approaches to hypothesis testing, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other proposed by Jerzy Neyman (for a historical summary, see Lehmann, 2011). The history is messy because Fisher and Neyman were real people whose opinions changed over time, and at no point did either of them offer “the definitive statement” of how we should interpret their work many decades later. That said, here’s a quick summary of these two approaches. First, let’s talk about Fisher’s approach. Fisher assumed that you only had one hypothesis (the null), and what you want to do is find out if the null hypothesis is inconsistent with the data. From his perspective, what you should do is check to see if the data are “sufficiently unlikely” according to the null. In fact, if you remember back to our earlier discussion, that’s how Fisher defines the \\(p\\)-value. According to Fisher, if the null hypothesis provided a very poor account of the data, you could safely reject it. But, since you don’t have any other hypotheses to compare it to, there’s no way of “accepting the alternative” because you don’t necessarily have an explicitly stated alternative. That’s more or less all that there was to it. In contrast, Neyman thought that the point of hypothesis testing was as a guide to action, and his approach was somewhat more formal than Fisher’s. His view was that there are multiple things you could do (accept the null or accept the alternative), and the point of the test was to tell you which one the data support. From this perspective, it is critical to specify your alternative hypothesis properly. If you don’t know the alternative hypothesis, then you don’t know how powerful the test is or which action makes sense. His framework genuinely requires competition between different hypotheses. For Neyman, the \\(p\\) value didn’t directly measure the probability of the data (or data more extreme) under the null; it was more of an abstract description about which “possible tests” were telling you to accept the null and which “possible tests” were telling you to accept the alternative. As you can see, what we have today is an odd mishmash of the two. We talk about having both a null hypothesis and an alternative (Neyman) but usually define the \\(p\\) value in terms of extreme data (Fisher), but we still have \\(\\alpha\\) values (Neyman). Some statistical tests have explicitly specified alternatives (Neyman), but others are quite vague about it (Fisher). And, according to some people, we’re not allowed to talk about accepting the alternative (Fisher). It’s a mess. 8.8.2 Bayesians versus frequentists Earlier in this chapter, we emphasised how you cannot interpret the \\(p\\) value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. NHST is fundamentally a frequentist tool (see Chapter 6), and as such, it does not allow you to assign probabilities to hypotheses: the null hypothesis is either true or not. The Bayesian approach to statistics interprets probability as a degree of belief, so it’s totally okay to say that there is a 10% chance that the null hypothesis is true: that’s just a reflection of your degree of confidence in this hypothesis. You aren’t allowed to do this within the frequentist approach. Remember, if you’re a frequentist, a probability can only be defined in terms of what happens after a large number of independent replications (i.e. a long-run frequency). If this is your interpretation of probability, talking about the “probability” that the null hypothesis is true is complete gibberish. Most importantly, this isn’t an ideological matter purely. If you decide that you are a Bayesian and are okay with making probability statements about hypotheses, you must follow the Bayesian rules for calculating those probabilities. We’ll talk more about this in Chapter 9, but for now, understand that \\(p\\) value is a terrible approximation to the probability that \\(H_0\\) is true. If what you want to know is the probability of the null, then the \\(p\\) value is not what you’re looking for! 8.8.3 Traps As you can see, the theory behind hypothesis testing is a mess, and even now, there are arguments in statistics about how it “should” work. However, disagreements among statisticians are not our real concern here. Our real concern is practical data analysis. And while the “orthodox” approach to null hypothesis significance testing has many drawbacks, even an unrepentant Bayesian would agree that they can be useful if used responsibly. They usually give sensible answers, and you can use them to learn interesting things. Setting aside the various ideologies and historical confusions that we’ve discussed, the fact remains that the biggest danger in all of statistics is thoughtlessness. Not stupidity but thoughtlessness. The rush to interpret a result without thinking through what each test says about the data and checking whether that’s consistent with how you’ve interpreted it. That’s where the biggest trap lies. To give an example of this, consider the following example (see Gelman &amp; Stern, 2006). Suppose we run the ESP study, and we’ve decided to analyse the data separately for the male and female participants. Of the male participants, 33 out of 50 guessed the card’s colour correctly. This is a significant effect (\\(p = .03\\)). Of the female participants, 29 out of 50 guessed correctly. This is not a significant effect (\\(p = .32\\)). Upon observing this, it is extremely tempting for people to start wondering why there is a difference between males and females regarding their psychic abilities. However, this doesn’t seem right. If you think about it, we haven’t actually run a test that explicitly compares males to females. All we have done is compare males to chance (binomial test was significant) and compare females to chance (binomial test was non-significant). If we want to argue that there is a real difference between the males and the females, we should probably run a test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference! We can do that using a different hypothesis test, but when we do that, it turns out that we have no evidence that males and females are significantly different (\\(p = .54\\)). Now do you think that there’s anything fundamentally different between the two groups? Of course not. What’s happened here is that the data from both groups (male and female) are pretty borderline: by pure chance, one of them happened to end up on the magic side of the \\(p = .05\\) line, and the other one didn’t. That doesn’t imply that males and females are different. This mistake is so common that you should always be wary of it: the difference between significant and not-significant is not evidence of a real difference – if you want to say that there’s a difference between two groups, then you have to test for that difference! Think about what it is you want to test, why you want to test it, and whether or not the answers that your test gives could possibly make any sense in the real world. 8.9 Summary Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements of statistical theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the results of some hypothesis test or another. As a consequence, it is almost impossible to get by in science without having at least a cursory understanding of what a \\(p\\)-value means, making this one of the most important chapters in the book. Here is a quick recap of the key ideas that we’ve talked about: Research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. Null and alternative hypotheses. (Section 8.1). Type 1 and Type 2 errors (Section 8.2) Test statistics and sampling distributions (Section 8.3) Hypothesis testing as a decision making process (Section 8.4) \\(p\\)-values as “soft” decisions (Section 8.5) Writing up the results of a hypothesis test (Section 8.6) Effect size and power (Section 8.7) A few issues to consider regarding hypothesis testing (Section 8.8) Later in the book, in Chapter 9, we’ll revisit the theory of null hypothesis tests from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a number of new tools that you can use if you aren’t particularly fond of the orthodox approach. But for now, though, we’re done with the abstract statistical theory, and we can start discussing specific data analysis tools. My apologies to anyone who actually believes in this stuff, but on my reading of the literature on ESP, it’s just not reasonable to think this is real. To be fair, though, some of the studies are rigorously designed; so it’s actually an interesting area for thinking about psychological research design.

A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. – David Hume34. The ideas I’ve presented to you in this book describe inferential statistics from the frequentist perspective. I’m not alone in doing this. In fact, almost every textbook given to undergraduate psychology students presents the opinions of the frequentist statistician as the theory of inferential statistics, the one true way to do things. I have taught this way for practical reasons. The frequentist view of statistics dominated the academic field of statistics for most of the 20th century, and this dominance is even more extreme among applied scientists. It was and is current practice among psychologists to use frequentist methods. Because frequentist methods are ubiquitous in scientific papers, every student of statistics needs to understand those methods, otherwise they will be unable to make sense of what those papers are saying! Unfortunately – in my opinion at least – the current practice in psychology is often misguided, and the reliance on frequentist methods is partly to blame. In this chapter I explain why I think this, and provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, an approach that I think is generally superior to the orthodox approach. This chapter comes in two parts. In Sections 9.1 through 11 I talk about what Bayesian statistics are all about, covering the basic mathematical rules for how it works as well as an explanation for why I think the Bayesian approach is so useful. Afterwards, I provide a brief overview of how you can do Bayesian versions of chi-square tests (Section ??), \\(t\\)-tests (Section ??), regression (Section ??) and ANOVA (Section ??). 9.1 Probabilistic reasoning by rational agents From a Bayesian perspective, statistical inference is all about belief revision. I start out with a set of candidate hypotheses \\(h\\) about the world. I don’t know which of these hypotheses is true, but do I have some beliefs about which hypotheses are plausible and which are not. When I observe the data \\(d\\), I have to revise those beliefs. If the data are consistent with a hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is strengthened. If the data inconsistent with the hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is weakened. That’s it! At the end of this section I’ll give a precise description of how Bayesian reasoning works, but first I want to work through a simple example in order to introduce the key ideas. Consider the following reasoning problem: I’m carrying an umbrella. Do you think it will rain? In this problem, I have presented you with a single piece of data (\\(d =\\) I’m carrying the umbrella), and I’m asking you to tell me your beliefs about whether it’s raining. You have two possible hypotheses, \\(h\\): either it rains today or it does not. How should you solve this problem? 9.1.1 Priors: what you believed before The first thing you need to do ignore what I told you about the umbrella, and write down your pre-existing beliefs about rain. This is important: if you want to be honest about how your beliefs have been revised in the light of new evidence, then you must say something about what you believed before those data appeared! So, what might you believe about whether it will rain today? You probably know that I live in Australia, and that much of Australia is hot and dry. And in fact you’re right: the city of Adelaide where I live has a Mediterranean climate, very similar to southern California, southern Europe or northern Africa. I’m writing this in January, and so you can assume it’s the middle of summer. In fact, you might have decided to take a quick look on Wikipedia35 and discovered that Adelaide gets an average of 4.4 days of rain across the 31 days of January. Without knowing anything else, you might conclude that the probability of January rain in Adelaide is about 15%, and the probability of a dry day is 85%. If this is really what you believe about Adelaide rainfall (and now that I’ve told it to you, I’m betting that this really is what you believe) then what I have written here is your prior distribution, written \\(P(h)\\): Hypothesis Degree of Belief Rainy day 0.15 Dry day 0.85 9.1.2 Likelihoods: theories about the data To solve the reasoning problem, you need a theory about my behaviour. When does Dan carry an umbrella? You might guess that I’m not a complete idiot,36 and I try to carry umbrellas only on rainy days. On the other hand, you also know that I have young kids, and you wouldn’t be all that surprised to know that I’m pretty forgetful about this sort of thing. Let’s suppose that on rainy days I remember my umbrella about 30% of the time (I really am awful at this). But let’s say that on dry days I’m only about 5% likely to be carrying an umbrella. So you might write out a little table like this: Hypothesis Umbrella No umbrella Rainy day 0.30 0.70 Dry day 0.05 0.95 It’s important to remember that each cell in this table describes your beliefs about what data \\(d\\) will be observed, given the truth of a particular hypothesis \\(h\\). This “conditional probability” is written \\(P(d|h)\\), which you can read as “the probability of \\(d\\) given \\(h\\)”. In Bayesian statistics, this is referred to as likelihood of data \\(d\\) given hypothesis \\(h\\).37 9.1.3 The joint probability of data and hypothesis At this point, all the elements are in place. Having written down the priors and the likelihood, you have all the information you need to do Bayesian reasoning. The question now becomes, how do we use this information? As it turns out, there’s a very simple equation that we can use here, but it’s important that you understand why we use it, so I’m going to try to build it up from more basic ideas. Let’s start out with one of the rules of probability theory. I listed it way back in Table 6.1, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it at the time and you probably ignored it. The rule in question is the one that talks about the probability that two things are true. In our example, you might want to calculate the probability that today is rainy (i.e., hypothesis \\(h\\) is true) and I’m carrying an umbrella (i.e., data \\(d\\) is observed). The joint probability of the hypothesis and the data is written \\(P(d,h)\\), and you can calculate it by multiplying the prior \\(P(h)\\) by the likelihood \\(P(d|h)\\). Mathematically, we say that: \\[ P(d,h) = P(d|h) P(h) \\] So, what is the probability that today is a rainy day and I remember to carry an umbrella? As we discussed earlier, the prior tells us that the probability of a rainy day is 15%, and the likelihood tells us that the probability of me remembering my umbrella on a rainy day is 30%. So the probability that both of these things are true is calculated by multiplying the two: \\[ \\begin{array} P(\\mbox{rainy}, \\mbox{umbrella}) &amp; = &amp; P(\\mbox{umbrella} | \\mbox{rainy}) \\times P(\\mbox{rainy}) \\\\ &amp; = &amp; 0.30 \\times 0.15 \\\\ &amp; = &amp; 0.045 \\end{array} \\] In other words, before being told anything about what actually happened, you think that there is a 4.5% probability that today will be a rainy day and that I will remember an umbrella. However, there are of course four possible things that could happen, right? So let’s repeat the exercise for all four. If we do that, we end up with the following table: Umbrella No-umbrella Rainy 0.045 0.105 Dry 0.0425 0.8075 This table captures all the information about which of the four possibilities are likely. To really get the full picture, though, it helps to add the row totals and column totals. That gives us this table: Umbrella No-umbrella Total Rainy 0.0450 0.1050 0.15 Dry 0.0425 0.8075 0.85 Total 0.0875 0.9125 1 This is a very useful table, so it’s worth taking a moment to think about what all these numbers are telling us. First, notice that the row sums aren’t telling us anything new at all. For example, the first row tells us that if we ignore all this umbrella business, the chance that today will be a rainy day is 15%. That’s not surprising, of course: that’s our prior. The important thing isn’t the number itself: rather, the important thing is that it gives us some confidence that our calculations are sensible! Now take a look at the column sums, and notice that they tell us something that we haven’t explicitly stated yet. In the same way that the row sums tell us the probability of rain, the column sums tell us the probability of me carrying an umbrella. Specifically, the first column tells us that on average (i.e., ignoring whether it’s a rainy day or not), the probability of me carrying an umbrella is 8.75%. Finally, notice that when we sum across all four logically-possible events, everything adds up to 1. In other words, what we have written down is a proper probability distribution defined over all possible combinations of data and hypothesis. Now, because this table is so useful, I want to make sure you understand what all the elements correspond to, and how they written: Umbrella No-umbrella Rainy \\(P\\)(Umbrella, Rainy) \\(P\\)(No-umbrella, Rainy) \\(P\\)(Rainy) Dry \\(P\\)(Umbrella, Dry) \\(P\\)(No-umbrella, Dry) \\(P\\)(Dry) \\(P\\)(Umbrella) \\(P\\)(No-umbrella) Finally, let’s use “proper” statistical notation. In the rainy day problem, the data corresponds to the observation that I do or do not have an umbrella. So we’ll let \\(d_1\\) refer to the possibility that you observe me carrying an umbrella, and \\(d_2\\) refers to you observing me not carrying one. Similarly, \\(h_1\\) is your hypothesis that today is rainy, and \\(h_2\\) is the hypothesis that it is not. Using this notation, the table looks like this: \\(d_1\\) \\(d_2\\) \\(h_1\\) \\(P(h_1, d_1)\\) \\(P(h_1, d_2)\\) \\(P(h_1)\\) \\(h_2\\) \\(P(h_2, d_1)\\) \\(P(h_2, d_2)\\) \\(P(h_2)\\) \\(P(d_1)\\) \\(P(d_2)\\) 9.1.4 Updating beliefs using Bayes’ rule The table we laid out in the last section is a very powerful tool for solving the rainy day problem, because it considers all four logical possibilities and states exactly how confident you are in each of them before being given any data. It’s now time to consider what happens to our beliefs when we are actually given the data. In the rainy day problem, you are told that I really am carrying an umbrella. This is something of a surprising event: according to our table, the probability of me carrying an umbrella is only 8.75%. But that makes sense, right? A guy carrying an umbrella on a summer day in a hot dry city is pretty unusual, and so you really weren’t expecting that. Nevertheless, the problem tells you that it is true. No matter how unlikely you thought it was, you must now adjust your beliefs to accommodate the fact that you now know that I have an umbrella.38 To reflect this new knowledge, our revised table must have the following numbers: Umbrella No-umbrella Rainy 0 Dry 0 Total 1 0 In other words, the facts have eliminated any possibility of “no umbrella”, so we have to put zeros into any cell in the table that implies that I’m not carrying an umbrella. Also, you know for a fact that I am carrying an umbrella, so the column sum on the left must be 1 to correctly describe the fact that \\(P(\\mbox{umbrella})=1\\). What two numbers should we put in the empty cells? Again, let’s not worry about the maths, and instead think about our intuitions. When we wrote out our table the first time, it turned out that those two cells had almost identical numbers, right? We worked out that the joint probability of “rain and umbrella” was 4.5%, and the joint probability of “dry and umbrella” was 4.25%. In other words, before I told you that I am in fact carrying an umbrella, you’d have said that these two events were almost identical in probability, yes? But notice that both of these possibilities are consistent with the fact that I actually am carrying an umbrella. From the perspective of these two possibilities, very little has changed. I hope you’d agree that it’s still true that these two possibilities are equally plausible. So what we expect to see in our final table is some numbers that preserve the fact that “rain and umbrella” is slightly more plausible than “dry and umbrella”, while still ensuring that numbers in the table add up. Something like this, perhaps? Umbrella No-umbrella Rainy 0.514 0 Dry 0.486 0 Total 1 0 What this table is telling you is that, after being told that I’m carrying an umbrella, you believe that there’s a 51.4% chance that today will be a rainy day, and a 48.6% chance that it won’t. That’s the answer to our problem! The posterior probability of rain \\(P(h|d)\\) given that I am carrying an umbrella is 51.4% How did I calculate these numbers? You can probably guess. To work out that there was a 0.514 probability of “rain”, all I did was take the 0.045 probability of “rain and umbrella” and divide it by the 0.0875 chance of “umbrella”. This produces a table that satisfies our need to have everything sum to 1, and our need not to interfere with the relative plausibility of the two events that are actually consistent with the data. To say the same thing using fancy statistical jargon, what I’ve done here is divide the joint probability of the hypothesis and the data \\(P(d,h)\\) by the marginal probability of the data \\(P(d)\\), and this is what gives us the posterior probability of the hypothesis given that we know the data have been observed. To write this as an equation:39 \\[ P(h | d) = \\frac{P(d,h)}{P(d)} \\] However, remember what I said at the start of the last section, namely that the joint probability \\(P(d,h)\\) is calculated by multiplying the prior \\(P(h)\\) by the likelihood \\(P(d|h)\\). In real life, the things we actually know how to write down are the priors and the likelihood, so let’s substitute those back into the equation. This gives us the following formula for the posterior probability: \\[ P(h | d) = \\frac{P(d|h) P(h)}{P(d)} \\] And this formula, folks, is known as Bayes’ rule. It describes how a learner starts out with prior beliefs about the plausibility of different hypotheses, and tells you how those beliefs should be revised in the face of data. In the Bayesian paradigm, all statistical inference flows from this one simple rule. http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hume↩︎ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Adelaide↩︎ It’s a leap of faith, I know, but let’s run with it okay?↩︎ Um. I hate to bring this up, but some statisticians would object to me using the word “likelihood” here. The problem is that the word “likelihood” has a very specific meaning in frequentist statistics, and it’s not quite the same as what it means in Bayesian statistics. As far as I can tell, Bayesians didn’t originally have any agreed upon name for the likelihood, and so it became common practice for people to use the frequentist terminology. This wouldn’t have been a problem, except for the fact that the way that Bayesians use the word turns out to be quite different to the way frequentists do. This isn’t the place for yet another lengthy history lesson, but to put it crudely: when a Bayesian says “a likelihood function” they’re usually referring one of the rows of the table. When a frequentist says the same thing, they’re referring to the same table, but to them “a likelihood function” almost always refers to one of the columns. This distinction matters in some contexts, but it’s not important for our purposes.↩︎ If we were being a bit more sophisticated, we could extend the example to accommodate the possibility that I’m lying about the umbrella. But let’s keep things simple, shall we?↩︎ You might notice that this equation is actually a restatement of the same basic rule I listed at the start of the last section. If you multiply both sides of the equation by \\(P(d)\\), then you get \\(P(d) P(h| d) = P(d,h)\\), which is the rule for how joint probabilities are calculated. So I’m not actually introducing any “new” rules here, I’m just using the same rule in a different way.↩︎ "],["bayesianhypothesistests.html", "Chapter 10 Bayesian hypothesis tests 10.1 The Bayes factor 10.2 Interpreting Bayes factors", " Chapter 10 Bayesian hypothesis tests In Chapter 8 I described the orthodox approach to hypothesis testing. It took an entire chapter to describe, because null hypothesis testing is a very elaborate contraption that people find very hard to make sense of. In contrast, the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing is incredibly simple. Let’s pick a setting that is closely analogous to the orthodox scenario. There are two hypotheses that we want to compare, a null hypothesis \\(h_0\\) and an alternative hypothesis \\(h_1\\). Prior to running the experiment we have some beliefs \\(P(h)\\) about which hypotheses are true. We run an experiment and obtain data \\(d\\). Unlike frequentist statistics Bayesian statistics does allow to talk about the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Better yet, it allows us to calculate the posterior probability of the null hypothesis, using Bayes’ rule: \\[ P(h_0 | d) = \\frac{P(d|h_0) P(h_0)}{P(d)} \\] This formula tells us exactly how much belief we should have in the null hypothesis after having observed the data \\(d\\). Similarly, we can work out how much belief to place in the alternative hypothesis using essentially the same equation. All we do is change the subscript: \\[ P(h_1 | d) = \\frac{P(d|h_1) P(h_1)}{P(d)} \\] It’s all so simple that I feel like an idiot even bothering to write these equations down, since all I’m doing is copying Bayes rule from the previous section.40 10.1 The Bayes factor In practice, most Bayesian data analysts tend not to talk in terms of the raw posterior probabilities \\(P(h_0|d)\\) and \\(P(h_1|d)\\). Instead, we tend to talk in terms of the posterior odds ratio. Think of it like betting. Suppose, for instance, the posterior probability of the null hypothesis is 25%, and the posterior probability of the alternative is 75%. The alternative hypothesis is three times as probable as the null, so we say that the odds are 3:1 in favour of the alternative. Mathematically, all we have to do to calculate the posterior odds is divide one posterior probability by the other: \\[ \\frac{P(h_1 | d)}{P(h_0 | d)} = \\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \\] Or, to write the same thing in terms of the equations above: \\[ \\frac{P(h_1 | d)}{P(h_0 | d)} = \\frac{P(d|h_1)}{P(d|h_0)} \\times \\frac{P(h_1)}{P(h_0)} \\] Actually, this equation is worth expanding on. There are three different terms here that you should know. On the left hand side, we have the posterior odds, which tells you what you believe about the relative plausibilty of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis after seeing the data. On the right hand side, we have the prior odds, which indicates what you thought before seeing the data. In the middle, we have the Bayes factor, which describes the amount of evidence provided by the data: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}\\displaystyle \\frac{P(h_1 | d)}{P(h_0 | d)} &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{P(d|h_1)}{P(d|h_0)} &amp;\\times&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{P(h_1)}{P(h_0)} \\\\[6pt] \\\\[-2pt] \\uparrow &amp;&amp; \\uparrow &amp;&amp; \\uparrow \\\\[6pt] \\mbox{Posterior odds} &amp;&amp; \\mbox{Bayes factor} &amp;&amp; \\mbox{Prior odds} \\end{array} \\] The Bayes factor (sometimes abbreviated as BF) has a special place in the Bayesian hypothesis testing, because it serves a similar role to the \\(p\\)-value in orthodox hypothesis testing: it quantifies the strength of evidence provided by the data, and as such it is the Bayes factor that people tend to report when running a Bayesian hypothesis test. The reason for reporting Bayes factors rather than posterior odds is that different researchers will have different priors. Some people might have a strong bias to believe the null hypothesis is true, others might have a strong bias to believe it is false. Because of this, the polite thing for an applied researcher to do is report the Bayes factor. That way, anyone reading the paper can multiply the Bayes factor by their own personal prior odds, and they can work out for themselves what the posterior odds would be. In any case, by convention we like to pretend that we give equal consideration to both the null hypothesis and the alternative, in which case the prior odds equals 1, and the posterior odds becomes the same as the Bayes factor. 10.2 Interpreting Bayes factors One of the really nice things about the Bayes factor is the numbers are inherently meaningful. If you run an experiment and you compute a Bayes factor of 4, it means that the evidence provided by your data corresponds to betting odds of 4:1 in favour of the alternative. However, there have been some attempts to quantify the standards of evidence that would be considered meaningful in a scientific context. The two most widely used are from Jeffreys (1961) and Kass &amp; Raftery (1995). Of the two, I tend to prefer the Kass &amp; Raftery (1995) table because it’s a bit more conservative. So here it is: Bayes factor Interpretation 1 - 3 Negligible evidence 3 - 20 Positive evidence 20 - 150 Strong evidence $&gt;$150 Very strong evidence And to be perfectly honest, I think that even the Kass and Raftery standards are being a bit charitable. If it were up to me, I’d have called the “positive evidence” category “weak evidence”. To me, anything in the range 3:1 to 20:1 is “weak” or “modest” evidence at best. But there are no hard and fast rules here: what counts as strong or weak evidence depends entirely on how conservative you are, and upon the standards that your community insists upon before it is willing to label a finding as “true”. In any case, note that all the numbers listed above make sense if the Bayes factor is greater than 1 (i.e., the evidence favours the alternative hypothesis). However, one big practical advantage of the Bayesian approach relative to the orthodox approach is that it also allows you to quantify evidence for the null. When that happens, the Bayes factor will be less than 1. You can choose to report a Bayes factor less than 1, but to be honest I find it confusing. For example, suppose that the likelihood of the data under the null hypothesis \\(P(d|h_0)\\) is equal to 0.2, and the corresponding likelihood \\(P(d|h_0)\\) under the alternative hypothesis is 0.1. Using the equations given above, Bayes factor here would be: \\[ \\mbox{BF} = \\frac{P(d|h_1)}{P(d|h_0)} = \\frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5 \\] Read literally, this result tells is that the evidence in favour of the alternative is 0.5 to 1. I find this hard to understand. To me, it makes a lot more sense to turn the equation “upside down”, and report the amount op evidence in favour of the null. In other words, what we calculate is this: \\[ \\mbox{BF}^\\prime = \\frac{P(d|h_0)}{P(d|h_1)} = \\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 2 \\] And what we would report is a Bayes factor of 2:1 in favour of the null. Much easier to understand, and you can interpret this using the table above. Obviously, this is a highly simplified story. All the complexity of real life Bayesian hypothesis testing comes down to how you calculate the likelihood \\(P(d|h)\\) when the hypothesis \\(h\\) is a complex and vague thing. I’m not going to talk about those complexities in this book, but I do want to highlight that although this simple story is true as far as it goes, real life is messier than I’m able to cover in an introductory stats textbook.↩︎ "],["whybayes.html", "Chapter 11 Why be a Bayesian?", " Chapter 11 Why be a Bayesian?
