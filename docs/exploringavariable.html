<p>Any time you get a new data set to look at, one of the first things you might want to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what <strong>descriptive statistics</strong> (as opposed to <em>inferential statistics</em>) is all about. In fact, to many people, the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>The first dataset we’ll be looking at is real data relating to the Australian Football League (AFL)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. To do this, let us load the <a href="resources/data/aflsmall.Rdata">aflsmall.Rdata</a> file.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:loadaflsmall"></span>
<img src="resources/load_aflsmall.png" alt="This is what you would see after loading the dataset." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.1: This is what you would see after loading the dataset.
</p>
</div>
<p>CogStat will help you get familiar with some essential aspects of your variable, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>measures of central tendency (mean, median)</li>
<li>measures of variability (range, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, quartiles)</li>
<li>measures of “distortion” (skewness, kurtosis).</li>
</ul>
<p>These will help you contextualise the results so the conclusions drawn from the variable will be valid.</p>
<p>To start understanding a variable, select
<code>Explore variable</code> so a pop-up appears. Move the name of the data you wish to analyse (in this case: <code>afl.margins</code>) from <code>Available variables</code> to <code>Selected variables</code>, then click <code>OK</code>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:rawaflsmall"></span>
<img src="resources/raw_aflsmall.png" alt="This is the first chart you will see exploring the raw shape of the data." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.2: This is the first chart you will see exploring the raw shape of the data.
</p>
</div>
<p>The first piece of information here is <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which we will use to refer to the number of observations we’re analysing. CogStat (or any other software for that matter) will only use valid data for calculations. Sometimes, mainly when working with survey data, you will have missing data points, the number of which you might have to mention in your written analysis. CogStat will quote these for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>N of valid cases: 176</code><br />
<code>N of missing cases: 0</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want to calculate is a measure of <strong><em>central tendency</em></strong>. That is, you’d like to know something about the “average” or “middle” of your data lies.</p>
<div id="mean" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> The mean<a href="exploringavariable.html#mean" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>mean</strong> of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned (arithmetic) average: add all of the values up and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32 (which CogStat will quote to you when loading the data, see Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:loadaflsmall">4.1</a>), so the mean of these observations is just:
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \frac{183}{5} = 36.60
\]</span>
Of course, this definition of the mean isn’t news to anyone: averages (i.e. means) are used so often in everyday life that this is quite familiar.</p>
<p>We used <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to denote the number of observations. Now let’s attach a label to the observations themselves. It’s traditional to use <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we’re actually talking about. That is, we’ll use <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> to refer to the first observation, <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to <span class="math inline">\(X_N\)</span> for the last one. The following table lists the 5 observations in the <code>afl.margins</code> variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to:</p>

<p>Okay, now let’s try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula:
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N}
\]</span>
This formula is entirely correct, but it’s terribly long, so we make use of the <strong><em>summation symbol</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle\sum\)</span> to shorten it.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, <span class="math inline">\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\)</span> or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this:
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i
\]</span>
Taken literally, this could be read as “the sum, taken over all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> values from 1 to 5, of the value <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>”. But basically, what it means is “add up the first five observations”. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this:
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i
\]</span></p>
<p>In all honesty, all this mathematical notation is just a fancy way of laying out the same things said in words: <em>add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items</em>. The goal here was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we’ll be using throughout the book: <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> for the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle\sum\)</span> for the idea of summation, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> for the total number of observations. We’re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so you must understand them well enough to be able to “read” the equations and to be able to see what they’re really saying.</p>
<p>CogStat calculates the mean automatically when exploring a variable using all valid data points, not just the first five. It will be part of the <code>Descriptives for the variable</code> section, as seen in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:histogramaflsmall">4.3</a>. The result for our variable is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>afl.margins</code><br />

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> The median<a href="exploringavariable.html#median" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The second measure of central tendency people use a lot is the <strong>median</strong>, and it’s even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. As before, let’s imagine we were interested only in the first 5 AFL winning margins: 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
8, 31, \mathbf{32}, 56, 56
\]</span></p>
<p>From inspection, it’s evident that the median value of these five observations is 32 since that’s the middle one in the sorted list. Easy stuff. But what should we do if we were interested in the first six games rather than the first 5? Since the sixth game in the season had a winning margin of 14 points, our sorted list is now</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
8, 14, \mathbf{31}, \mathbf{32}, 56, 56
\]</span></p>
<p>and there are <em>two</em> middle numbers, 31 and 32. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is 31.5.</p>
<p>In the data set we loaded to CogStat, there were 176 valid cases, so we ought to have two middle numbers. The result in this case is (as seen in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:histogramaflsmall">4.3</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>afl.margins</code><br />
<code>Median 30.5</code></p>

In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger.
</p>
</div>
<p>Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, what that implies, and which one to choose. This is illustrated in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:meanmedian">4.4</a>; the mean is kind of like the “centre of gravity” of the data set, whereas the median is the “middle value” in the data. What this implies about which one you should use depends a little on what type of data you’ve got and what you’re trying to achieve. As a rough guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your data are <em><a href="researchdesign.html#nominalscale">nominal scale</a></em>, you probably shouldn’t be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it’s probably best to use the mode (Section <a href="exploringavariable.html#mode">4.1.5</a>) instead.</li>
<li>If your data are <em><a href="researchdesign.html#ordinalscale">ordinal scale</a></em>, you’re more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only uses the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are larger) but doesn’t depend on the precise numbers involved. That’s precisely the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. Conversely, the mean makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it’s not appropriate for ordinal data.</li>
<li>For <em><a href="researchdesign.html#intervalscale">interval</a></em> and <em><a href="researchdesign.html#ratioscale">ratio scale</a></em> data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you’re trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage of using all the information in the data (which is useful when you don’t have a lot of data), but it’s very susceptible to extreme values, as we’ll see in Section <a href="exploringavariable.html#trimmedmean">4.1.4</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section <a href="exploringavariable.html#skewnesskurtosis">4.3</a>). This is illustrated in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:meanmedian">4.4</a> notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you’re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here.</p>

<div id="trimmedmean" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Trimmed mean<a href="exploringavariable.html#trimmedmean" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One of the fundamental rules of applied statistics is that the data are messy. Real life is never simple, so the data sets you obtain are never as straightforward as the statistical theory says.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This can have awkward consequences. To illustrate, consider this rather strange-looking data set:
<span class="math display">\[
-100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
\]</span>
If you were to observe this in a real-life data set, you’d probably suspect that there is something odd about the <span class="math inline">\(-100\)</span> value. It’s probably an <strong>outlier</strong>, a value that doesn’t belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely. In this particular case, it might be the right call. In real life, however, you don’t always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead:
<span class="math display">\[
-15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12
\]</span>
The <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span> looks suspicious, but not as much as that <span class="math inline">\(-100\)</span> did. In this case, it’s a little trickier. It <em>might</em> be a legitimate observation; it might not.</p>
<p>When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values and thus is not considered a <em>robust</em> measure. One remedy that we’ve seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a “trimmed mean”. To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is “discard” the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest) and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median: just like a median, you aren’t highly influenced by extreme outliers, but like the mean, you “use” more than one of the observations.</p>
<p>Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observations on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations <em>and</em> the smallest 10% of the observations and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations. Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median.</p>
<p>For our toy example above, we have 10 observations. So a 10% trimmed mean is calculated by ignoring the largest value (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>) and the smallest value (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span>) and taking the mean of the remaining values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Mean: 4.1</code><br />
<code>Median: 5.5</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a fairly substantial difference. But the mean is being influenced too much by the extreme values at either end of the data set, especially the <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span> one. If we take a 10% trimmed mean, we’ll drop the extreme values on either side and take the mean of the rest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Mean: 5.5</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which, in this case, gives exactly the same answer as the median.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no direct way for you to do that in CogStat, but you can certainly trim those outlying data points in your source file and re-load the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="mode" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Mode<a href="exploringavariable.html#mode" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>mode</strong> of a sample is straightforward: it is the value that occurs most frequently.</p>
<p>In CogStat, you will see a <strong>frequency table</strong> (Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:freqaflsmall">4.5</a>) of the values in your data if you have <code>Frequencies</code> ticked in the <code>Explore variable</code> dialogue.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:freqaflsmall"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.5: The frequency table sorts non-nominal values from lowest to highest.
</p>
</div>
<p>While it’s generally true that the mode is most often calculated when you have <a href="researchdesign.html#nominalscale">nominal scale</a> data – because means and medians are useless for those sorts of variables –, there are some situations in which you do want to know the mode of an <a href="researchdesign.html#ordinalscale">ordinal</a>, <a href="researchdesign.html#intervalscale">interval</a> or <a href="researchdesign.html#ratioscale">ratio scale</a> variable.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s look at our <code>afl.margins</code> variable we loaded into CogStat. This variable is clearly ratio scale, and so in most situations the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario… a friend of yours is offering a bet. They pick a football game at random, and (without knowing who is playing) you have to guess the <em>exact</em> margin. If you guess correctly, you win $50. If you don’t, you lose $1. There are no consolation prizes for “almost” getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> For this bet, the mean and the median are completely useless to you. It is the mode that you should bet on. So, we look at the frequency table offered by the result set: the data suggest you should bet on a <span class="math inline">\(3.0\)</span> point margin, and since this was observed in 8 of the 176 games (4.5% of games – the <em>relative frequency</em>), the odds are firmly in your favour.</p>

<div id="var" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Measures of variability<a href="exploringavariable.html#var" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The statistics that we’ve discussed so far all relate to <em>central tendency</em>. They all talk about which values are “in the middle” or “popular” in the data. However, central tendency is not the only type of summary statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the <strong>variability</strong> of the data. That is, how “spread out” are the data? How “far” away from the mean or median do the observed values tend to be? For now, let’s assume that the data are interval or ratio scale, so we’ll continue to use the <code>afl.margins</code> data. We’ll use this data to discuss several different measures of spread, each with different strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<div id="range" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Range<a href="exploringavariable.html#range" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>range</strong> of a variable is very simple: it’s the largest value minus the smallest value. For the AFL winning margins data, the maximum value is <span class="math inline">\(116\)</span>, and the minimum is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so the range is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[116-0=\mathbf{116}\]</span></p>
<p>CogStat automatically calculates all these values (see Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:histogramaflsmall">4.3</a>), so there is nothing we need to do about this, only to understand what it implies.</p>
<p>Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of “variability”, it’s one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it, we’d like our statistics not to be unduly influenced by these cases. Let us look once again at our toy example of a data set containing very extreme outliers:
<span class="math display">\[
-100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
\]</span></p>
<p>It is clear that the range is not robust since this has a range of <span class="math inline">\(110\)</span>, but if the outlier was removed, we would have a range of only <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="IQR" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Interquartile range<a href="exploringavariable.html#IQR" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>interquartile range</strong> (IQR) is like the range, but instead of calculating the difference between the largest and smallest value, it calculates the difference between the 25th and 75th quantile.</p>
<p>Probably you already know what a <strong>quantile</strong> is (or more commonly called <strong>percentile</strong>), but if not: the 10th percentile of a data set is the smallest number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that 10% of the data is less than <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In fact, we’ve already come across the idea: the median of a data set is its 50th quantile/percentile! <strong>Quartile</strong> is another specific term used for the 25th (lower), 50th (median), and 75th (upper) percentile, as it is splitting the data set into four (hence ‘<em>quart-</em>’) equal parts.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>CogStat provides you with both the 25th (<code>Lower quartile</code>) and 75th quantiles (<code>Upper quartile</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Upper quartile: 50.5</code><br />
<code>Lower quartile: 12.8</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that the interquartile range for the 2010 AFL winning margins data is:
<span class="math display">\[
50.5 - 12.8 = \mathbf{37.7}
\]</span></p>
<p>While it’s obvious how to interpret the range, it’s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the “middle half” of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile, one quarter of the data is above the 75th percentile, leaving the “middle half” of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half.</p>

<div id="aad" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Mean absolute deviation<a href="exploringavariable.html#aad" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The two measures we’ve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at quantiles. However, this isn’t the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select some meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the “typical” deviations from that. What do we mean by “typical” deviation? Usually, the mean or median value of these deviations. In practice, this leads to two different measures, the “mean absolute deviation” (from the mean) and the “median absolute deviation” (from the median). The measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics and might be the better of the two, but it’s less frequently used in psychology, per Danielle’s observation. The measure based on the mean occasionally shows up in psychology; hence we will cover this measure in this chapter.</p>
<p>One useful thing about <strong>mean absolute deviation</strong> is that the name tells you exactly how to calculate it. Let’s think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again we’ll start by pretending that there’s only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case, the mean), the first thing we need to look up is the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>. For these five observations, our mean is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X} = 36.6\)</span>. The next step is to convert each of our observations <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and the mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>. That is, the deviation score is defined to be <span class="math inline">\(X_i - \bar{X}\)</span>. For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to <span class="math inline">\(56 - 36.6 = 19.4\)</span>. The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(-3\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(|-3|\)</span>, and so we say that <span class="math inline">\(|-3| = 3\)</span>. We use the absolute value function here because we don’t care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean; we’re just interested in how <em>close</em> it is to the mean. To help make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these calculations for all five observations:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th align="left">its symbol</th>
<th align="left">the observed value</th>

<td align="left">32 points</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that we have calculated the absolute deviation score for every observation in the data set, we only have to calculate the mean of these scores. Let’s do that:
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{19.4 + 5.6 + 19.4 + 28.6 + 4.6}{5} = 15.52
\]</span>
And we’re done. The mean absolute deviation for these five scores is 15.52.</p>
<p>However, while our calculations for this little example are at an end, we do have a couple of things left to talk about. Firstly, we should really try to write down a proper mathematical formula. But in order to do this, we need some mathematical notation to refer to the mean absolute deviation. Irritatingly, “mean absolute deviation” and “median absolute deviation” have the same acronym (MAD), which leads to a certain amount of ambiguity. What we’ll do is use AAD instead, short for <em>average</em> absolute deviation. Now that we have some unambiguous notation, here’s the formula that describes what we just calculated:
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{}(X) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \bar{X}|
\]</span></p>
<p>The last thing we must discuss is how to calculate AAD in CogStat. Currently, the software does not automatically compute this, and no manual interventions exist. This calculation might get added in a future release if needed, but if you bear with us for two more chapters, you’ll see a more useful measure instead.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Variance<a href="exploringavariable.html#variance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Although the mean absolute deviation measure has its uses, it’s not the best measure of variability. From a purely mathematical perspective, there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations over absolute deviations. With square deviations, we obtain a measure called <strong>variance</strong>.</p>
<p>The variance of a data set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is sometimes written as <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Var}(X)\)</span>, but it’s more commonly denoted <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>. The reason for this will become clearer shortly. The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows:
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\mbox{Var}(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2}{N}\]</span>
As you can see, it’s basically the same formula that we used to calculate the mean absolute deviation, except that instead of using “absolute deviations”, we use “squared deviations”. For this reason, the variance is sometimes referred to as the “mean square deviation”.</p>
<p>Variances are <em>additive</em>. Here’s what that means: suppose we have two variables (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>), whose variances are <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Var}(X)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Var}(Y)\)</span> respectively. Now imagine we want to define a new variable <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> that is the sum of the two, <span class="math inline">\(Z = X+Y\)</span>. As it turns out, the variance of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Var}(X) + \mbox{Var}(Y)\)</span>. This is a <em>very</em> useful property, but it’s not true of the other measures.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got the basic idea let’s look at a concrete example. Once again, let’s use the first five AFL games as our data. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="14%" />
<col width="11%" />

<td align="right">32</td>
<td align="right">-4.6</td>
<td align="right">21.16</td>

</table>
<p>That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to do is average them.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{( 376.36 + 31.36 + 376.36 + 817.96 + 21.16 )}{5} = 324.64
\]</span></p>
<p>Exciting, isn’t it? Now, let’s tackle the burning question you’re probably thinking: What does a variance of 324.64 mean? How do you <em>interpret</em> the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now, the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why we haven’t given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn’t one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it’s utterly useless if you want to communicate with an actual human. Variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable. All the numbers have been squared, and they don’t mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue.</p>
<p>CogStat will not attempt to interpret the variance nor will it give you the raw value. But the next chapter will show you another measure instead: the <em>standard deviation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="sd" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Standard deviation<a href="exploringavariable.html#sd" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Suppose you would like to have a measure expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e. points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the <strong>standard deviation</strong>, also called the “root mean squared deviation”, or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly: while nobody has a clue what “a variance of 324.68 points-squared” really means, it’s much easier to understand “a standard deviation of 18.01 points” since it’s expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, though “<strong>SD</strong>” and “<strong>Std dev.</strong>” are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won’t be surprised to see that the formula is:
<span class="math display">\[
s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2 }
\]</span></p>
<p>Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn’t have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us rely on a simple rule of thumb: in general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation (1 sigma) of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviation (2 sigmas) of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations (3 sigmas) of the mean. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but it’s not exact: it’s actually calculated based on an <em>assumption</em> that the histogram is symmetric and “bell shaped”, i.e. the data are <em>normally</em> distributed, which is an important concept that we’ll discuss more in Chapter <a href="probability.html#probability">6</a>.</p>
<p>So how do we interpret standard deviation? Basically, if the standard deviation is small (relatively closer to zero), then the data are clustered close to the mean. Conversely, if the standard deviation is large (relatively closer to the interquartile range), then the data are more spread out.</p>
<p>As you can tell from the AFL winning margins histogram in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:histogramaflsmall">4.3</a>, this isn’t exactly true of our data! Even so, the rule is approximately correct. As it turns out, 65.3% of the AFL margins data fall within one standard deviation of the mean.</p>
</div>
<div id="mad" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.6</span> Median absolute deviation<a href="exploringavariable.html#mad" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The last measure of variability to talk about is the <strong>median absolute deviation</strong> (MAD). The basic idea behind MAD is identical to the one behind the mean absolute deviation (Section <a href="exploringavariable.html#aad">4.2.3</a>). The difference is that you use the median everywhere.</p>
<p>This has a straightforward interpretation: every observation in the data set lies some distance away from the typical value (the median). So the MAD is an attempt to describe a <em>typical deviation from a typical value</em> in the data set. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to interpret the MAD value of <span class="math inline">\(19.5\)</span> for our AFL data by saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The median winning margin in 2010 was 30.5, indicating that a typical game involved a winning margin of about 30 points. However, there was a fair amount of variation from game to game: the MAD value was 19.5, indicating that a typical winning margin would differ from this median value by about 19-20 points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way that the mean is very sensitive to extreme values, so is the standard deviation. So, in much the same way that people sometimes use the median as a “robust” way of calculating “something that is like the mean”, it’s not uncommon to use MAD as a method for calculating “something that is like the standard deviation”. Unfortunately, the <em>raw</em> MAD value doesn’t do this. Our raw MAD value is 19.5, and our standard deviation was 26.07. Under the assumption again that the data are normally distributed, you can multiply the raw MAD value by 1.4826 and obtain a number that is directly comparable to the standard deviation. That’s really <em>not</em> true for our <code>afl.margins</code> data, so in this case I wouldn’t try to use the MAD value this way.</p>
<p>As standard deviation is used almost all of the time in psychology research, CogStat will not be calculating MAD for you.</p>

<div id="which-measure-to-use" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.7</span> Which measure to use?<a href="exploringavariable.html#which-measure-to-use" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We’ve discussed quite a few measures of spread (range, IQR, MAD, variance and standard deviation) and hinted at their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Range</em>. Gives you the full spread of the data. It’s very vulnerable to outliers, and as a consequence, it isn’t often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data.</li>
<li><em>Interquartile range</em>. Tells you where the “middle half” of the data sits. It’s pretty robust and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot.</li>
<li><em>Mean absolute deviation</em>. Tells you how far “on average” the observations are from the mean. It’s very interpretable but has a few minor issues that make it less attractive to statisticians than the standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often.</li>
<li><em>Variance</em>. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It’s mathematically elegant and is probably the “right” way to describe variation around the mean, but it’s completely uninterpretable because it doesn’t use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool, but it’s buried “under the hood” of a very large number of statistical tools.</li>
<li><em>Standard deviation</em>. This is the square root of the variance. It’s fairly elegant mathematically, and it’s expressed in the same units as the data, so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation.</li>
<li><em>Median absolute deviation</em>. The typical (i.e., median) deviation from the median value. In the raw form, it’s simple and interpretable; in the corrected form, it’s a robust way to estimate the standard deviation for some kinds of data sets. Not used very often, but it does get reported sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common measures used to report the variability of the data. Still, there are situations in which range or other measures are used.</p>

<div id="skewnesskurtosis" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Skewness and kurtosis<a href="exploringavariable.html#skewnesskurtosis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see reported in the psychological literature, known as <strong>skewness</strong> and <strong>kurtosis</strong>. In practice, neither is used nearly as frequently as the central tendency and variability measures we’ve discussed. Skewness is critical, so you see it mentioned a fair bit.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:skewness"></span>
<img src="lsc_files/figure-html/skewness-1.svg" alt="An illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set (skewness $= -.93$), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (technically, skewness $= -.006$), and on the right we have a positively skewed data set (skewness $= .93$)." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.6: An illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set (skewness <span class="math inline">\(= -.93\)</span>), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (technically, skewness <span class="math inline">\(= -.006\)</span>), and on the right we have a positively skewed data set (skewness <span class="math inline">\(= .93\)</span>).
</p>
</div>
<p>Since it’s the more interesting of the two, let’s start by talking about the <strong>skewness</strong>. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry, and the easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:skewness">4.6</a> illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel), then we say that the data are <em>negatively skewed</em>. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are <em>positively skewed</em>. That’s the qualitative idea behind skewness. The actual formula for the skewness of a data set is as follows
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{skewness}(X) = \frac{1}{N \hat{\sigma}^3} \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \bar{X})^3
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of observations, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> is the sample mean, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}\)</span> is the standard deviation (the “divide by <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>” version, that is).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it turns out that the AFL winning margins data is fairly skewed: <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span>.</p>
<p>Put simply, <strong>kurtosis</strong> is a measure of the “pointiness” of a data set, as illustrated in Figure <a href="exploringavariable.html#fig:kurtosis">4.7</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:kurtosis"></span>
<img src="lsc_files/figure-html/kurtosis-1.svg" alt="An illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a &quot;platykurtic&quot; data set (kurtosis = $-.95$), meaning that the data set is &quot;too flat&quot;. In the middle we have a &quot;mesokurtic&quot; data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0), which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a &quot;leptokurtic&quot; data set (kurtosis $= 2.12$) indicating that the data set is &quot;too pointy&quot;. Note that kurtosis is measured with respect to a normal curve (black line)" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.7: An illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a “platykurtic” data set (kurtosis = <span class="math inline">\(-.95\)</span>), meaning that the data set is “too flat”. In the middle we have a “mesokurtic” data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0), which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a “leptokurtic” data set (kurtosis <span class="math inline">\(= 2.12\)</span>) indicating that the data set is “too pointy”. Note that kurtosis is measured with respect to a normal curve (black line)
</p>
</div>
<p>By convention, we say that the “normal curve” (black lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this curve. In this Figure, the data on the left is not pointy enough, so the kurtosis is negative, and we call the data <em>platykurtic</em>. The data on the right are too pointy, so the kurtosis is positive and we say that the data is <em>leptokurtic</em>. But the data in the middle are just pointy enough, so we say that it is <em>mesokurtic</em> and has kurtosis zero. This is summarised in the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">informal term</th>
<th align="left">technical name</th>
<th align="left">kurtosis value</th>

<tr class="odd">

<td align="left">zero</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">too pointy</td>
<td align="left">leptokurtic</td>
<td align="left">positive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The equation for kurtosis is similar in spirit to the formulas we’ve seen already for the variance and the skewness. Except that where the variance involved squared deviations and the skewness involved cubed deviations, the kurtosis involves raising the deviations to the fourth power:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{kurtosis}(X) = \frac{1}{N \hat\sigma^4} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^4 - 3
\]</span></p>
<p>When reading the automatically calculated kurtosis value from our CogStat result set, we discover that the AFL winning margins data is just pointy enough: <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>.</p>
