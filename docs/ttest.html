<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 10</span> Comparing two means<a href="ttest.html#ttest" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we covered the situation when your outcome variable is a nominal scale, and your predictor variable<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> is also a nominal scale. Many real-world situations have that character, so you’ll find that chi-square tests are widely used.</p>
<p>However, you’re much more likely to find yourself in a situation where your outcome variable is interval scale or higher, and you’re interested in whether the outcome variable’s average value is higher in one group or another. For instance, a psychologist might want to know if anxiety levels are higher among parents than non-parents; or if working memory capacity is reduced by listening to music (relative to not listening to music). In a medical context, we might want to know if a new drug increases or decreases blood pressure. An agricultural scientist might want to know whether adding phosphorus to Australian native plants will kill them. In all these situations, our outcome variable is a continuous interval or ratio scale variable; and our predictor is a binary “grouping” variable. In other words, we want to compare the <em>means of the two groups</em>.</p>
<p>The standard answer to the problem of comparing means is to use a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, which has several varieties depending on exactly what question you want to solve. As a consequence, the majority of this chapter focuses on different types of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test:</p>
<p>-one sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests are discussed in Section <a href="ttest.html#onesamplettest">10.2</a>,
-independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests are discussed in Sections <a href="ttest.html#studentttest">10.3</a> and <a href="#welchttest"><strong>??</strong></a>, and
- paired samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests are discussed in Section <a href="#pairedsamplesttest"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After that, we’ll talk a bit about Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, which is the standard measure of effect size for a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (Section <a href="#cohensd"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The later sections of the chapter focus on the assumptions of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests and possible remedies if they are violated. However, before discussing any of these useful things, we’ll start with a discussion of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test.</p>
<div id="the-one-sample-z-test" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> The one-sample <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test<a href="ttest.html#the-one-sample-z-test" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll discuss one of the most useless tests in all of statistics: the <strong><span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test</strong>. Seriously – this test is seldom used in real life. Its only real purpose is that, when teaching statistics, it’s a very convenient stepping stone towards the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, which is probably the most (over)used tool in all statistics.</p>
<p>Let’s use a simple example to introduce the idea behind the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test. A friend of Danielle’s, Dr Zeppo, grades his introductory statistics class on a curve. Let’s suppose that the average grade in his class is 67.5, and the standard deviation is 9.5. Of his many hundreds of students, it turns out that 20 of them also take psychology classes. Out of curiosity: do psychology students tend to get the same grades as everyone else (i.e. mean 67.5), or do they tend to score higher or lower? Let’s explore this by looking at the <a href="resources/data/zeppo.csv"><code>zeppo.csv</code></a> data file by loading the file to CogStat.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:cogstatloadzeppo"></span>
<img src="resources/image/cogstatloadzeppo.png" alt="The `zeppo.csv` data file loaded into CogStat."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 10.1: The <code>zeppo.csv</code> data file loaded into CogStat.
</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s explore the data a bit by looking at some summary statistics with the <code>Explore variable</code> function.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:cogstatexplorezeppo"></span>
<img src="resources/image/cogstatexplorezeppo.png" alt="The `Explore variable` function in CogStat."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The mean is <span class="math inline">\(72.3\)</span>. Hm. It <em>might</em> be that the psychology students are scoring a bit higher than normal: that sample mean of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X} = 72.3\)</span> is a fair bit higher than the hypothesised population mean of <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 67.5\)</span>, but on the other hand, a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(N = 20\)</span> isn’t all that big. Maybe it’s pure chance.</p>
<p>To answer the question, it helps to be able to write down what it is that we know. Firstly, we know that the sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X} = 72.3\)</span>. If we assume that the psychology students have the same standard deviation as the rest of the class, then we can say that the population standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 9.5\)</span>. We’ll also assume that since Dr Zeppo is grading to a curve, the psychology student grades are normally distributed.</p>
<p>Next, it helps to be clear about what we want to learn from the data. In this case, the research hypothesis relates to the <em>population</em> mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> for the psychology student grades, which is unknown. Specifically, we want to know if <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 67.5\)</span> or not. Given that this is what we know, can we devise a hypothesis test to solve our problem? The data, along with the hypothesised distribution from which they are thought to arise, are shown in Figure <a href="ttest.html#fig:zeppo">10.3</a>. Not entirely obvious what the right answer is, is it? For this, we are going to need some statistics.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The first step in constructing a hypothesis test is to be clear about what the null and alternative hypotheses are. This isn’t too hard to do. Our null hypothesis, <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, is that the true population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> for psychology student grades is 67.5%; and our alternative hypothesis is that the population mean <em>isn’t</em> 67.5%. If we write this in mathematical notation, these hypotheses become,
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: &amp; \mu = 67.5 \\
H_1: &amp; \mu \neq 67.5
\end{array}
\]</span>
though to be honest, this notation doesn’t add much to our understanding of the problem, it’s just a compact way of writing down what we’re trying to learn from the data. The null hypotheses <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and the alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> for our test are both illustrated in Figure <a href="ttest.html#fig:ztesthyp">10.4</a>. In addition to providing us with these hypotheses, the scenario outlined above provides us with a fair amount of background knowledge that might be useful. Specifically, there are two special pieces of information that we can add:</p>
<ul>
<li>The psychology grades are normally distributed.</li>
<li>The true standard deviation of these scores <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known to be 9.5.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the moment, we’ll act as if these are absolutely trustworthy facts. In real life, this kind of absolutely trustworthy background knowledge doesn’t exist, and so if we want to rely on these facts we’ll just have make the <em>assumption</em> that these things are true. However, since these assumptions may or may not be warranted, we might need to check them. For now though, we’ll keep things simple.</p>

Figure 10.4: Graphical illustration of the null and alternative hypotheses assumed by the one sample <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test (the two sided version, that is). The null and alternative hypotheses both assume that the population distribution is normal, and additionally assumes that the population standard deviation is known (fixed at some value <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_0\)</span>). The null hypothesis (left) is that the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is equal to some specified value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean differs from this value, <span class="math inline">\(\mu \neq \mu_0\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The next step is to figure out what would be a good choice for a diagnostic test statistic, something that would help us discriminate between <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Given that the hypotheses all refer to the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, you’d feel confident that the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> would be a helpful place to start. We could look at the difference between the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> and the value that the null hypothesis predicts for the population mean. In our example, that would mean we calculate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X} - 67.5\)</span>. More generally, if we let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> refer to the value that the null hypothesis claims is our population mean, then we’d want to calculate
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} - \mu_0
\]</span>
If this quantity equals or is very close to 0, things are looking good for the null hypothesis. If this quantity is a long way away from 0, then it looks less likely that the null hypothesis is worth retaining. But how far away from zero should it be for us to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>?</p>
<p>To figure that out, we need to be a bit more sneaky, and we’ll need to rely on those two pieces of background knowledge shared previously, namely that the raw data are normally distributed, and we know the value of the population standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. If the null hypothesis is actually true, and the true mean is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>, then these facts together mean that we know the complete population distribution of the data: a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Adopting the notation from Section <a href="probability.html#normal">6.4.2</a>, a statistician might write this as:
<span class="math display">\[
X \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_0,\sigma^2)
\]</span></p>
<p>Okay, if that’s true, then what can we say about the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>? Well, as we discussed earlier (see Section <a href="estimation.html#clt">7.3.3</a>), the sampling distribution of the mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> is also normal, and has mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. But the standard deviation of this sampling distribution <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}})\)</span>, which is called the <em>standard error of the mean</em>, is
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, if the null hypothesis is true then the sampling distribution of the mean can be written as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_0,\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}}))
\]</span></p>
<p>Now comes the trick. What we can do is convert the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> into a standard score (Section <a href="exploringavariable.html#zscore">4.4</a>). This is conventionally written as <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, but for let us refer to it as <span class="math inline">\(z_{\bar{X}}\)</span>. (The reason for using this expanded notation is to help you remember that we’re calculating standardised version of a sample mean, <em>not</em> a standardised version of a single observation, which is what a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score usually refers to). When we do so, the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score for our sample mean is
<span class="math display">\[
z_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}})}
\]</span>
or, equivalently
<span class="math display">\[
z_{\bar{X}} =  \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{N}}
\]</span>
This <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score is our test statistic. The nice thing about using this as our test statistic is that like all <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-scores, it has a standard normal distribution:
<span class="math display">\[
z_{\bar{X}} \sim \mbox{Normal}(0,1)
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, regardless of what scale the original data are on, the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-statistic itself always has the same interpretation: it’s equal to the number of standard errors that separate the observed sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> from the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> predicted by the null hypothesis. Better yet, regardless of what the population parameters for the raw scores actually are, the 5% critical regions for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test are always the same, as illustrated in Figures <a href="ttest.html#fig:ztest1">10.6</a> and <a href="ttest.html#fig:ztest2">10.5</a>. And what this meant, way back in the days where people did all their statistics by hand, is that someone could publish a table like this:</p>
<table>

<p>which in turn meant that researchers could calculate their <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-statistic by hand, and then look up the critical value in a text book. That was an incredibly handy thing to be able to do back then.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Now, as mentioned earlier, the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test is almost never used in practice. However, the test is so incredibly simple that it’s really easy to do one manually. Let’s go back to the data from Dr Zeppo’s class. However, we’re not going to use CogStat for the rest of this section, because it will automatically (and correctly) use the population parameter estimates, that will actually come in handy in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test section. So from now on, let’s just follow the logic without the urge to try to replicate it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sample size is <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> (we know this from Figure <a href="ttest.html#fig:cogstatloadzeppo">10.1</a>).</li>
<li>The <em>mean</em> is <span class="math inline">\(72.3\)</span> (we know this from Figure <a href="ttest.html#fig:cogstatexplorezeppo">10.2</a>).</li>
<li>The point estimation for standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(9.5\)</span> (we have to just believe this for the example’s sake because we said so earlier).</li>
<li>The null hypothesis is that the mean is <span class="math inline">\(67.5\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s calculate the (true) standard error of the mean:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{9.5}{\sqrt{20}} = 2.1243
\]</span></p>
<p>And finally, we calculate our <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{72.3-67.5}{2.1243} = 2.2596
\]</span></p>
<p>At this point, we would traditionally look up the value 2.26 in our table of critical values. Our original hypothesis was two-sided (we didn’t really have any theory about whether psychology students would be better or worse at statistics than other students), so our hypothesis test is two-sided (or two-tailed) also.</p>
<p>Looking at the little table shown earlier, we can see that 2.26 is bigger than the critical value of 1.96 that would be required to be significant at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span> but smaller than the value of 2.58 that would be required to be significant at a level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span>. Therefore, we can conclude that we have a significant effect, which we might write up by saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a mean grade of 73.2 in the sample of psychology students, and assuming a true population standard deviation of 9.5, we can conclude that the psychology students have significantly different statistics scores to the class average (<span class="math inline">\(z = 2.26\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N=20\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, what if want an exact <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value? Well, back in the day, the tables of critical values were huge, so you could look up your actual <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-value and find the smallest value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for which your data would be significant (which, as discussed earlier, is the very definition of a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value). However, we are here just to discuss the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test in order for us to understand the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, so we will not go into the details of how to do this. However, if you are interested, you can find a table of critical values <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/z-table/">here</a>. All in all, our <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is <span class="math inline">\(0.0238\)</span>.</p>
<p>All statistical tests make assumptions. Some tests make reasonable assumptions, while other tests do not. The one sample <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test makes three basic assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Normality</em>. As usually described, the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test assumes that the true population distribution is normal.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> is often pretty reasonable, and not only that, it’s an assumption that we can check if we feel worried about it (see Section <a href="#shapiro"><strong>??</strong></a>).</li>
<li><em>Independence</em>. The second assumption of the test is that the observations in your data set are not correlated with each other or related to each other in some funny way. This isn’t as easy to check statistically: it relies a bit on good experimental design. An obvious example of something that violates this assumption is a data set where you “copy” the same observation over and over again in your data file: so you end up with a massive “sample size” consisting of only one genuine observation. More realistically, you have to ask yourself if it’s really plausible to imagine that each observation is an entirely random sample from the population you’re interested in. In practice, this assumption is never met; but we try our best to design studies that minimise the problems of correlated data.</li>
<li><em>Known standard deviation</em>. The third assumption of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test is that the true standard deviation of the population is known to the researcher. This is just stupid. In no real-world data analysis problem do you know the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of some population but are completely ignorant about the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. In other words, this assumption is <em>always</em> wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the stupidity of assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known, let’s see if we can live without it. This takes us out of the dreary domain of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test and into the magical kingdom of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, with unicorns, fairies, and leprechauns.</p>
</div>
<div id="onesamplettest" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.2">

<p>It might not be safe to assume that the psychology student grades necessarily have the same standard deviation as the other students in Dr Zeppo’s class. After all, if we were entertaining the hypothesis that they don’t have the same mean, why should we assume they have the same standard deviation? In view of this, we must stop assuming we know the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. However, this violates the assumptions of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test, which brings us back to square one. However, we still have the raw data loaded into CogStat, and those can give us an <em>estimate</em> of the population standard deviation.</p>
<p>Having loaded the <code>grades</code> data and explored the descriptive statistics, let us take note of a few data points from the <code>Descriptives for the variable</code> and the <code>Population parameter estimations</code> section of the CogStat output. But first, let us re-run the <code>Explore variable</code> option, but now let us tell CogStat to use our null hypothesis of <span class="math inline">\(67.5\)</span>. To do that, we have to fill in <code>67.5</code> in our dialogue:</p>

<p>In other words, while we can’t say that we <em>know</em> that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 9.5\)</span>, we <em>can</em> say that <span class="math inline">\(\hat\sigma = 9.5\)</span>. (Actually it’s <span class="math inline">\(9.520615\)</span> but CogStat rounds it to one decimal when displayed, but it uses the exact value for any calculation.)</p>
<p>Because we are now relying on an <em>estimate</em> of the population standard deviation, we need to make some adjustment for the fact that we have some uncertainty about what the true population standard deviation actually is. Maybe our data are just a fluke … maybe the true population standard deviation is 11, for instance. But if that were actually true, and we ran the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test assuming <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=11\)</span>, then the result would end up being <em>non-significant</em>. That’s a problem, and it’s one we’re going to have to address.</p>

<p>This ambiguity is annoying, and it was resolved in 1908 by a guy called William Sealy Gosset <span class="citation">(Student, 1908)</span>, who was working as a chemist for the Guinness brewery at the time <span class="citation">(see Box, 1987)</span>. Because Guinness took a dim view of its employees publishing statistical analysis (apparently, they felt it was a trade secret), he published the work under the pseudonym “A Student”, and to this day, the full name of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is actually <strong>Student’s <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test</strong>. The critical thing that Gosset figured out is how we should accommodate the fact that we aren’t entirely sure what the true standard deviation is.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The answer is that it subtly changes the sampling distribution.</p>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, our test statistic (now called a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic) is calculated in exactly the same way as mentioned above. If our null hypothesis is that the true mean is <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, but our sample has mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> and our estimate of the population standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}\)</span>, then our <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> statistic is:
<span class="math display">\[
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{N} }
\]</span></p>
<p>The only thing that has changed in the equation is that instead of using the known true value <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, we use the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}\)</span>. And if this estimate has been constructed from <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations, then the sampling distribution turns into a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> <strong>degrees of freedom</strong> (df). The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution is very similar to the normal distribution but has “heavier” tails, as discussed earlier in Section <a href="probability.html#otherdists">6.4.4</a> and illustrated in Figure <a href="ttest.html#fig:ttestdist">10.8</a>.</p>
<p>Notice, though, that as df gets larger, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution starts to look identical to the standard normal distribution. This is as it should be: if you have a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(N = 70000000\)</span>, then your “estimate” of the standard deviation would be pretty much perfect, right? So, you should expect that for large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test would behave the same way as a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test. And that’s exactly what happens!</p>

<p>As you might expect, the mechanics of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test are almost identical to the mechanics of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test. So there’s not much point in going through the tedious exercise of showing you how to do the calculations: it’s pretty much identical to the calculations that we did earlier, except that we use the estimated standard deviation, and then we test our hypothesis using the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution rather than the normal distribution.</p>
<p>So let’s just do it quickly in CogStat: let’s just go through the output. You can see that the <code>Population parameter estimations</code> stayed the same, so no need to quote them here again. However, let’s see the <code>Hypothesis tests</code> results.</p>

<p>Let us go through them line by line.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Testing if mean deviates from the value 67.5.</code>: good, we are made sure we are testing against a null hypothesis of <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 67.5\)</span>.</li>
<li><code>Interval variable. &gt;&gt; Choosing one-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test depending on the assumption.</code>: this means that depending on normality (which is an assumption of both <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests), CogStat will choose either the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We will discuss the Wilcoxon signed-rank test later on.</li>
<li><code>Normality is not violated. &gt;&gt; Running one-sample t-test.</code>: this is good, because we know that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is only valid if the data are normally distributed.</li>
<li><code>One sample t-test against 67.5: t(19) = 2.25, p &lt; .036</code>: this is the result of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic is 2.25, and the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is 0.036. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 67.5\)</span> at the 5% level of significance. In other words, we can conclude that the mean of the sample is significantly different from 67.5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget to take note of the Mean’s 95% confidence interval values from the <code>Population parameter estimations</code>, and now we could report the result by saying something like this:</p>

<p>With a mean grade of 72.3, the psychology students scored slightly higher than the average grade of 67.5 (<span class="math inline">\(t(19) = 2.25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span>); the 95% confidence interval is [67.8, 76.8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t(19)\)</span> is shorthand notation for a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic that has 19 degrees of freedom. That said, it’s often the case that people don’t report the confidence interval, or do so using a much more compressed form. For instance, it’s not uncommon to see the confidence interval included as part of the stat block, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t(19) = 2.25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span>, CI<span class="math inline">\(_{95} = [67.8, 76.8]\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that much jargon crammed into half a line, you know it must be really smart.</p>
<p>Okay, so what assumptions does the one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test make? Well, since the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test with the premise of known standard deviation removed, you shouldn’t be surprised to see that it makes the same assumptions as the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test, minus the one about the known standard deviation. That is</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Normality</em>. We’re still assuming that the population distribution is normal.</li>
<li><em>Independence</em>. Once again, we have to assume that the observations in our sample are generated independently of one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, these two assumptions aren’t terribly unreasonable, and as a consequence, the one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is pretty widely used in practice as a way of comparing a sample mean against a hypothesised population mean.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> The independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (Student test)<a href="ttest.html#studentttest" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Although the one sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test has its uses, it’s not the most typical example of a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. A much more common situation arises when you’ve got two different groups of observations. In psychology, this tends to correspond to two different groups of participants, where each group corresponds to a different condition in your study. For each person in the study, you measure some outcome variable of interest, and the research question that you’re asking is whether or not the two groups have the same population mean. This is the situation that the independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is designed for.</p>
<p>Suppose we have 33 students taking Dr Harpo’s statistics lectures, and Dr Harpo doesn’t grade to a curve. Actually, Dr Harpo’s grading is a bit of a mystery, so we don’t really know anything about what the average grade is for the class as a whole. There are two tutors for the class, Anastasia and Bernadette. There are <span class="math inline">\(N_1 = 15\)</span> students in Anastasia’s tutorials, and <span class="math inline">\(N_2 = 18\)</span> in Bernadette’s tutorials. The research question we’re interested in is whether Anastasia or Bernadette is a better tutor, or if it doesn’t make much of a difference.</p>
<p>As usual, let’s load the file <a href="resources/data/harpo.csv"><code>harpo.csv</code></a>.</p>
<p><img src="resources/image/cogstatloadharpo.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As we can see, we have two variables: <code>grade</code> and <code>tutor</code>. The <code>grade</code> variable is a numeric interval variable, containing the grades for all <span class="math inline">\(N = 33\)</span> students taking Dr Harpo’s class; the <code>tutor</code> variable is a categorical (nominal) data that indicates who each student’s tutor was.</p>
<p>Let’s run the <code>Compare groups</code> function so we can get some information about the grades by tutor.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:harpocompare"></span>

<p>In the boxplot generated by CogStat, we have the grades, the means and corresponding confidence intervals. We can see that the grades for Anastasia’s students are slightly higher than those for Bernadette’s students. We can also see that the variance of the grades for Bernadette’s students is slightly higher than that for Anastasia’s students.</p>

<p>The <strong>independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test</strong> comes in two different forms, Student’s and Welch’s. The original Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test – which is the one we’ll describe in this section – is the simpler of the two but relies on much more restrictive assumptions than the Welch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. Assuming for the moment that you want to run a two-sided test, the goal is to determine whether two “independent samples” of data are drawn from populations with the same mean (the null hypothesis) or different means (the alternative hypothesis).</p>
<p>When we say “independent” samples, what we really mean here is that there’s no special relationship between observations in the two samples. This probably doesn’t make a lot of sense right now, but it will be clearer when we come to talk about the paired samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test later on. For now, let’s just point out that if we have an experimental design where participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups, and we want to compare the two groups’ mean performance on some outcome measure, then an independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (rather than a paired samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test) is what we’re after.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> denote the true population mean for group 1 (e.g., Anastasia’s students), and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> will be the true population mean for group 2 (e.g., Bernadette’s students),<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and as usual, we’ll let <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_2\)</span> denote the observed sample means for both of these groups. Our null hypothesis states that the two population means are identical (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>), and the alternative to this is that they are not (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \neq \mu_2\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

</p>
</div>
<p>To construct a hypothesis test that handles this scenario, we start by noting that if the null hypothesis is true, then the difference between the population means is <em>exactly</em> zero,
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>As a consequence, a diagnostic test statistic will be based on the difference between the two sample means. Because if the null hypothesis is true, then we’d expect
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2
\]</span>
to be <em>pretty close</em> to zero. However, just like we saw with our one-sample tests (i.e. the one-sample <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test and the one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test) we have to be precise about exactly <em>how close</em> to zero this difference should be. And the solution to the problem is more or less the same one: we calculate a standard error estimate (SE), just like last time, and then divide the difference between means by this estimate. So our <strong><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic</strong> will be of the form
<span class="math display">\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\mbox{SE}}
\]</span>
We just need to figure out what this standard error estimate actually is. This is a bit trickier than was the case for either of the two tests we’ve looked at so far, so we need to go through it a lot more carefully to understand how it works.</p>
<p>In the original “Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test”, we make the assumption that the two groups have the same population standard deviation: that is, regardless of whether the population means are the same, we assume that the population standard deviations are identical, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1 = \sigma_2\)</span>. Since we’re assuming that the two standard deviations are the same, we drop the subscripts and refer to both of them as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>How should we estimate this? How should we construct a single estimate of a standard deviation when we have two samples? The answer is, we take a <em>weighed</em> average of the <em>variance</em> estimates, which we use as our <strong>pooled estimate of the variance</strong>. The weight assigned to each sample is equal to the number of observations in that sample, minus 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
w_1 &amp;=&amp; N_1 - 1\\
w_2 &amp;=&amp; N_2 - 1
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now that we’ve assigned weights to each sample, we calculate the pooled estimate of the variance by taking the weighted average of the two variance estimates, <span class="math inline">\({\hat\sigma_1}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\hat\sigma_2}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat\sigma^2_p = \frac{w_1 {\hat\sigma_1}^2 + w_2 {\hat\sigma_2}^2}{w_1 + w_2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we convert the pooled variance estimate to a pooled standard deviation estimate, by taking the square root. This gives us the following formula for <span class="math inline">\(\hat\sigma_p\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[
\hat\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{w_1 {\hat\sigma_1}^2 + w_2 {\hat\sigma_2}^2}{w_1 + w_2}}
\]</span></p>
<p>And if you mentally substitute <span class="math inline">\(w_1 = N_1 -1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_2 = N_2 -1\)</span> into this equation, you get a very ugly formula that actually seems to be the “standard” way of describing the pooled standard deviation estimate.</p>
<p>But let us describe it a bit differently:</p>
<p>Our data set actually corresponds to a set of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations, which are sorted into two groups. So let’s use the notation <span class="math inline">\(X_{ik}\)</span> to refer to the grade received by the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th student in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th tutorial group: that is, <span class="math inline">\(X_{11}\)</span> is the grade received by the first student in Anastasia’s class, <span class="math inline">\(X_{21}\)</span> is her second student, and so on. And we have two separate group means <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_2\)</span>, which we could “generically” refer to using the notation <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_k\)</span>, i.e.,the mean grade for the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th tutorial group. Since every single student falls into one of the two tutorials, and so we can describe their deviation from the group mean as the difference
<span class="math display">\[
X_{ik} - \bar{X}_k
\]</span></p>
<p>So why not just use these deviations (i.e. the extent to which each student’s grade differs from the mean grade in their tutorial)? Remember, a variance is just the average of a bunch of squared deviations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\sum_{ik} \left( X_{ik} - \bar{X}_k \right)^2}{N}
\]</span>
where the notation “<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{ik}\)</span>” is a lazy way of saying “calculate a sum by looking at all students in all tutorials”, since each “<span class="math inline">\(ik\)</span>” corresponds to one student. But, as we saw in Chapter <a href="estimation.html#estimation">7</a>, calculating the variance by dividing by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> produces a biased estimate of the population variance. And previously, we needed to divide by <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> to fix this. However, the reason why this bias exists is because the variance estimate relies on the sample mean; and to the extent that the sample mean isn’t equal to the population mean, it can systematically bias our estimate of the variance. But this time we’re relying on <em>two</em> sample means! Does this mean that we’ve got more bias? Yes, yes it does. And does this mean we now need to divide by <span class="math inline">\(N-2\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>, in order to calculate our pooled variance estimate? Why, yes…
<span class="math display">\[
\hat\sigma^2_p = \frac{\sum_{ik} \left( X_{ik} - \bar{X}_k \right)^2}{N -2}
\]</span>
Oh, and if you take the square root of this then you get <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_p\)</span>, the pooled standard deviation estimate. In other words, the pooled standard deviation calculation is nothing special: it’s not terribly different to the regular standard deviation calculation.</p>
<p>Regardless of which way you want to think about it, we now have our pooled estimate of the standard deviation. From now on, we’ll refer to this estimate as <span class="math inline">\(\hat\sigma\)</span>. Let’s now go back to thinking about the hypothesis test.</p>
<p>Our whole reason for calculating this pooled estimate was that we knew it would be helpful when calculating our <em>standard error</em> estimate. But, standard error of <em>what</em>? In the one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, it was the standard error of the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}})\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}}) = \sigma / \sqrt{N}\)</span> that’s what the denominator of our <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic looked like. This time around, however, we have <em>two</em> sample means. And what we’re interested in, specifically, is the the difference between the two <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2\)</span>. Consequently, the standard error that we need to divide by is in fact the <strong>standard error of the difference</strong> between means. As long as the two variables really do have the same standard deviation, then our estimate for the standard error is
<span class="math display">\[
\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}) = \hat\sigma \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_1} + \frac{1}{N_2}}
\]</span>
and our <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic is therefore
<span class="math display">\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\mbox{SE}({\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2})}
\]</span></p>
<p>Just as we saw with our one-sample test, the sampling distribution of this <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic is a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution as long as the null hypothesis is true, and all of the assumptions of the test are met. The degrees of freedom, however, is slightly different. As usual, we can think of the degrees of freedom to be equal to the number of data points minus the number of constraints. In this case, we have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations (<span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> in sample 1, and <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> in sample 2), and 2 constraints (the sample means). So the total degrees of freedom for this test are <span class="math inline">\(N-2\)</span>.</p>

<p>The output from CogStat has a very familiar form. Let’s start to talk about the confidence interval, and for that, let’s circle back to our <code>Population parameter estimations</code>:</p>

</div>
<p>It’s pretty important to be clear on what this confidence interval actually refers to: it is a confidence interval for the <em>difference</em> between the group means. In our example, Anastasia’s students had an average grade of 74.5, and Bernadette’s students had an average grade of 69.1, so the difference between the two sample means is 5.5 (due to rounding). But of course the difference between population means might be bigger or smaller than this. The confidence interval reported tells you that there’s a 95% chance that the true difference between means lies between 0.2 and 10.8.</p>
<p>In any case, the difference between the two groups is significant (just barely), so we might write up the result using text like this based on Figures <a href="ttest.html#fig:harpocompare">10.9</a> and <a href="#fig:cogstatharpohypo"><strong>??</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mean grade in Anastasia’s class was 74.5 (SD = 8.7), whereas the mean in Bernadette’s class was 69.1 (SD = 5.6). A Student’s independent samples <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test showed that this 5.5 difference was significant (<span class="math inline">\(t(31) = 2.12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(CI_{95} = [0.2, 10.8]\)</span>), suggesting that a genuine difference in learning outcomes has occurred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a bare minimum, you’d expect to see the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic, the degrees of freedom and the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> value. So you should include something like this at a minimum: <span class="math inline">\(t(31) = 2.1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span>. If statisticians had their way, everyone would also report the confidence interval and probably the effect size measure too, because they are useful things to know. But real life doesn’t always work the way statisticians want it to: you should make a judgment based on whether you think it will help your readers, and (if you’re writing a scientific paper) the editorial standard for the journal in question. Some journals expect you to report effect sizes, others don’t. Within some scientific communities it is standard practice to report confidence intervals, in other it is not. You’ll need to figure out what your audience expects.</p>
<p>Before moving on to talk about the assumptions of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, there’s one additional point to make about the use of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests in practice. The first one relates to the sign of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic (that is, whether it is a positive number or a negative one). One very common worry that students have when they start running their first <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is that they often end up with negative values for the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic, and don’t know how to interpret it. On closer inspection, the students will notice that the confidence intervals also have the opposite signs. This is perfectly okay. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic calculated in CogStat is always of the form
<span class="math display">\[
t = \frac{\mbox{(mean 1)} -\mbox{(mean 2)}}{ \mbox{(SE)}}
\]</span>
If “mean 1” is larger than “mean 2” the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> statistic will be positive, whereas if “mean 2” is larger then the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> statistic will be negative. Similarly, the confidence interval is the confidence interval for the difference “(mean 1) minus (mean 2)”, which will be the reverse of what you’d get if you were calculating the confidence interval for the difference “(mean 2) minus (mean 1)”.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s pretty straightforward when you think about it, but now consider our <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test comparing Anastasia’s class to Bernadette’s class. Which one does CogStat call “mean 1” and which one should we call “mean 2”? Let’s look at the order of how the data is presented. Anastasia goes first in all the result outputs. So, we would write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anastasia’s class had <em>higher</em> grades than Bernadette’s class (<span class="math inline">\(t(31)= 2.1, p=.04\)</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, suppose the phrasing we wanted to use has Bernadette’s class listed first. If so, it makes more sense to treat her class as group 1, and if so, the write up looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bernadette’s class had <em>lower</em> grades than Anastasia’s class (<span class="math inline">\(t(31)= -2.1, p=.04\)</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we’re talking about one group having “lower” scores this time around, it is more sensible to use the negative form of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic. It just makes it read more cleanly.</p>
<p>One last thing: please note that you <em>can’t</em> do this for other types of test statistics. It works for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests, but it wouldn’t be meaningful for chi-square tests, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-tests. So don’t overgeneralise this advice!</p>
<p>As always, our hypothesis test relies on some assumptions. For the Student t-test there are three assumptions, some of which we saw previously in the context of the one sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Normality</em>. Specifically, we assume that both groups are normally distributed.</li>
<li><em>Independence</em>. In the context of the Student test this has two aspects to it. Firstly, we assume that the observations within each sample are independent of one another (exactly the same as for the one-sample test). However, we also assume that there are no cross-sample dependencies. If, for instance, it turns out that you included some participants in both experimental conditions of your study (e.g. by accidentally allowing the same person to sign up to different conditions), then there are some cross sample dependencies that you’d need to take into account.</li>
<li><em>Homogeneity of variance</em> (also called “homoscedasticity”). The third assumption is that the population standard deviation is the same in both groups. CogStat tests this assumption using the Levene test automatically, as you’ve seen in the result output. But we’ll talk about later on in the book (Section <a href="#levene"><strong>??</strong></a>).</li>
